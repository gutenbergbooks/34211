<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&bull;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>This work is designed to present the leading facts and principles of
  human Physiology and Hygiene in clear and concise language, so that
  pupils in schools and colleges, and readers not familiar with the
  subjects, may readily comprehend them. Anatomy, or a description of the
  structure of an organ, is of course necessary to the understanding of its
  Physiology, or its uses. Enough of the former study has, therefore, been
  introduced, to enable the pupil to enter intelligently upon the
  latter.</p>

  <p>Familiar language, as far as practicable, has been employed, rather
  than that of a technical character. With a view, however, to supply what
  might seem to some a deficiency in this regard, a Pronouncing Glossary
  has been added, which will enable the inquirer to understand the meaning
  of many scientific terms not in common use.</p>

  <p>In the preparation of the work the writer has carefully examined all
  the best material at his command, and freely used it; the special object
  being to have it abreast of the present knowledge on the subjects
  treated, as far as such is possible in a work so elementary as this. The
  discussion of disputed points has been avoided, it being manifestly
  inappropriate in a work of this kind.</p>

  <p>Instruction in the rudiments of Physiology in schools does not
  necessitate the general practice of dissections, or of experiments upon
  animals. The most important subjects may be illustrated by <!-- Page 4
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>{4}</span>drawings, such as
  are contained in this work. Models, especially those constructed by <span
  class="sc">Auzoux</span> of Paris, dried preparations of the human body,
  and the organs of the lower animals, may also be used with advantage.</p>

  <p>The writer desires to acknowledge his indebtedness to <span
  class="sc">R. M. Wyckoff</span>, M.D., for valuable aid in the
  preparation of the manuscript for the press; and to <span class="sc">R.
  Cresson Stiles</span>, M.D., a skilful microscopist and physician, for
  the chapter "On the Use of the Microscope in the Study of Physiology."
  Mr. <span class="sc">Avon C. Burnham</span>, the well-known teacher of
  gymnastics, furnished the drawing of the parlor gymnasium and the
  directions for its use.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&bull;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>The Human Body is the abode of an immortal spirit, and is the most
  complete and perfect specimen of the Creator's handiwork. To examine its
  structure, to ascertain the uses and modes of action of its various
  parts, how to protect it from injury, and maintain it in a healthy
  condition, is the design of this work.</p>

  <p>The departments of knowledge which are concerned in these
  investigations, are the science of Human Physiology and the art of
  Hygiene.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Physiology</span> treats of the vital actions and
  uses of the various parts of living bodies, whether vegetable or animal.
  Every living thing, therefore, has a Physiology. We have a
  <i>Vegetable</i> Physiology, which relates to plants; and an
  <i>Animal</i> Physiology, relating to the animal kingdom. The latter is
  also divided into <i>Comparative</i> Physiology, which treats of the
  inferior races of animals, and <i>Human</i> Physiology, which teaches the
  uses of the various parts of the human body.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Hygiene</span>, or the art of preserving health, is
  the practical use of Physiology. It teaches us how to cultivate our
  bodily and mental powers, so as to increase our strength and to fit us
  for a higher enjoyment of life. It also shows us how to prevent some of
  the accidents which may befall the body, and to avoid disease. It is
  proper that we should <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page12"></a>{12}</span>understand the construction and powers of
  our bodies; but it is our duty, as rational beings, to know the laws by
  which health and strength may be maintained and disease warded off.</p>

  <p>There are various means by which we gain important information
  respecting the Physiology of man. Plants aid us in understanding the
  minute structure of the human body, its circulation, and absorption. From
  inferior animals we learn much in respect to the workings of the
  different <i>organs</i>, as we call those parts of the system which have
  a particular duty to perform. In one of them, as in the foot of the frog,
  we can study the circulation of the blood; in another, we can study the
  action of the brain.</p>

  <p>By <i>vivisection</i>, or the laying bare of some organ of a living
  animal, we are able to investigate certain vital processes which are too
  deeply hidden in the human body to be studied directly. This is not
  necessarily a cruel procedure, as we can, by the use of anæsthetics, so
  blunt the sensibility of the animal under operation, that he need not
  suffer while the experiment is being performed. There are other means by
  which we gather our information. There are occasionally men, who, from
  some accident, present certain parts, naturally out of view, in exposed
  positions. In these cases, our knowledge is of much greater value than
  when obtained from creatures lower in the scale of being than man.</p>

  <p>We are greatly aided, also, by the use of various instruments of
  modern invention. Chief among these is the microscope, which is, as we
  shall learn hereafter, an arrangement and combination of lenses in such a
  way as greatly to magnify the objects we wish to examine. <!-- Page 13
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>{13}</span></p>

  <p>We have much to say of Life, or vital activity, in the course of our
  study of Physiology; but the most that we know of it is seen in its
  results. What Life is, or where its precise position is, we are not able
  to determine. We discover one thing, however, that all the parts of the
  body are united together with wonderful sympathy, so that one part cannot
  be injured and other parts not suffer damage. It is further evident that
  all organs are not equally important in carrying on the work of Life; for
  some may temporarily suspend their action, without serious results to the
  system, while others must never cease from acting. Yet there is nothing
  superfluous or without aim in our frames, and no part or organ can suffer
  harm without actual loss to the general bodily health. On this point
  Science and Holy Writ strictly agree.</p>

  is composed of the <i>Bones</i>. The superstructure consists of the
  various organs on which the processes of life depend. These organs are
  soft and delicately formed, and, if unprotected, would, in most cases,
  rapidly be destroyed when subjected to violence, however slight. The
  bones, having great strength and power of resistance, afford the
  protection required.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>2.</b> The more delicate the organ? Example in relation to the brain? The eye? The lungs? The services performed by the bones?</div>
  <p><b>2.</b> The more delicate the organ, the more completely does Nature
  shield it. For example: the brain, which is soft in structure, is
  enclosed on all sides by a complete box of bone; the eye, though it must
  be near the surface of the body to command an extensive view, is
  sheltered from injury within a deep recess of bone; the lungs, requiring
  freedom of motion as well as protection, are surrounded by a large case
  of bone and muscle. The bones serve other useful purposes. They give
  permanence of form to the body, by <!-- Page 16 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>{16}</span>holding the softer parts
  in their proper places. They assist in movement, by affording points of
  attachment to those organs which have power of motion&mdash;the
  muscles.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>3.</b> Their shape and size? Of what composed? Possibility of being separated? Effect of fire? Of dilute acid?</div>
  <p><b>3. The Form and Composition of the Bones.</b>&mdash;Their shape and
  size vary greatly in different parts of the body, but generally they are
  arranged in pairs, one bone for each side of the body. They are composed
  of both mineral and animal substances, united in the proportion of two
  parts of the former to one of the latter; and we may separate each of
  these substances from the other for examination. First, if we expose a
  bone to the action of fire, the animal substance is driven off, or
  "burned out." We now find that, though the shape of the bone is perfectly
  retained, what is left is no longer tough, and does not sustain weight as
  before. Again, we may remove the mineral portion, which is a form of
  lime, by placing a bone into a dilute acid. The lime will be dissolved
  out, and the shape of the bone remain as before; but now its firmness has
  disappeared, and it may be bent without breaking.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>4.</b> Effect of deficiency of ingredient? Usefulness of the lime? Of the animal substance? Effect of their union? Condition, in youth? Old age?</div>
  <p><b>4.</b> If, for any reason, either of these ingredients is
  disproportionate in the bone during life, the body is in danger. The lime
  is useful in giving rigidity of form, while the animal substance insures
  toughness and elasticity. By their union, we are able to withstand
  greater shocks and heavier falls than would be possible with either
  alone. In youth, the period of greatest activity, the animal constituent
  is in excess: a bone then does not break so readily, but, when broken,
  unites with great rapidity and strength. On the other hand, the bones of
  old persons are more easily broken, and in some cases fail to unite. The
  mineral matter being then in excess, indicates that the period of active
  exertion is drawing to a close.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>5.</b> In what respect admirably fashioned? Its formation? Microscopic examination? The inference? "Line of beauty?"</div>
  <p><b>5. The Structure of the Bones.</b>&mdash;If we examine one of the
  long bones, which has been sawn through lengthwise, we observe that it is
  admirably fashioned for affording lightness as well as strength (Fig. 1).
  Its exterior is hard and resisting, but it is porous at the broad
  extremities, while through the central portion there is a cavity or canal
  which contains an oily substance, called <i>marrow</i>. Let us now take a
  thin section of bone, and examine it under the microscope; we discover
  that it is pierced by numerous fine tubes (Fig. 2), about which layers of
  bone-substance are arranged. Accordingly, though a bone be as hard as
  stone externally, it is by no means as heavy as stone, by reason of its
  light interior texture. Another element of power is found in the curved
  outline of the bones. The curved line is said to be "the line of beauty,"
  as it certainly is the line of strength, and is uniformly employed in the
  bones whose position exposes them to accident.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>6.</b> Number of bones? Skeleton? The skull? Chest? The trunk? The trunk and skull, how maintained? What of the arms? Legs?</div>
  <p><b>6. The Skeleton.</b>&mdash;The number of bones in the human body
  exceeds two hundred. When these are joined together in the proper places,
  they form what is termed the <i>Skeleton</i> (Fig. 3). It embraces three
  important cavities. The first, surmounting the frame, is a box of bone,
  called the <i>skull;</i> below this, is a bony case, or "chest;" and
  lower down is a bony basin, called the <i>pelvis</i>. The two latter
  compose the trunk. The trunk and skull are maintained in their proper
  relations by the "spinal column." Branching from the trunk are two sets
  of limbs: the arms, which are attached to the chest by means of the
  "collar-bone" and "shoulder-blade;" and the legs, directly joined to the
  lower part of the trunk.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>7.</b> Design of the cavities? Give the examples.</div>
  <p><b>7.</b> The cavities of which we have spoken, are designed for the
  lodgment and protection of the more delicate and perishable parts of the
  system. Thus, the skull, together with the bones of the face, shelters
  the brain and the organs of four senses&mdash;sight, hearing, smell, and
  taste. The chest contains the heart, lungs, and great blood-vessels,
  while the lower part of the trunk sustains the liver, stomach, and other
  organs.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>8.</b> Joint or articulation? Movable joints, how compacted? The ligaments of the movable joints? What is a sprain? Consequence of a serious sprain?</div>
  <p><b>8. The Joints.</b>&mdash;The point of union of two or more bones
  forms a joint or <i>articulation</i>, the connection being made in
  various ways according to the kind and amount of motion desired. The
  movable joints are compacted together by certain strong fibrous bands,
  called ligaments. These ligaments are of a shining, silvery whiteness,
  and very unyielding; so much so, that when sudden violence is brought to
  bear in the vicinity of a joint, the bone to which a ligament is attached
  may be broken, while the ligament itself remains uninjured. When this
  connecting material of the joints is strained or lacerated by an <!--
  Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page20"></a>{20}</span>accident, a "sprain" is the consequence. An
  injury of this sort may be, and frequently is, quite as serious as the
  breaking of a bone.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>9.</b> Office of the ligament? What must it have? How accomplished? Describe it. Synovia?</div>
  <p><b>9.</b> The ligament, then, secures firmness to the joint; it must
  also have flexibility and smoothness of motion. This is accomplished by a
  beautiful mechanism the perfection of which is only feebly imitated by
  the most ingenious contrivance of man. The ends of the bones are covered
  by a thin layer of <i>cartilage</i>, which being smooth and elastic,
  renders all the movements of the joint very easy. In addition to this,
  there is an arrangement introduced for "lubricating" the joint, by means
  of a delicate sac containing fluid. This fluid is constantly supplied in
  small quantities, but only so fast as it is used up in exercise. In
  appearance, it is not unlike the white of an egg, and hence its name
  <i>synovia</i>, or egg-like.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>10.</b> What do we observe as regards the composition of a joint? The ligament and cartilage? What varies? Example of the skull? Other examples? The ball-and-socket joint?</div>
  <p><b>10.</b> Thus, we observe, that two very different substances enter
  into the composition of a joint. The ligament, very unyielding, affords
  strength, while the cartilage, elastic and moist, gives ease and
  smoothness of motion. The amount of motion provided for varies greatly in
  different joints. In some there is none at all, as in the skull, where
  one bone is dove-tailed into another by what are termed <i>sutures</i>.
  Others have a hinge-like motion, such as those of the elbow, wrist,
  ankle, and knee; the most complete of these being the elbow-joint (Fig.
  5). Belonging to another class, the <!-- Page 21 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>{21}</span>ball-and-socket joint, is
  that at the shoulder, possessing a freedom of motion greater than any
  other in the body.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>11.</b> What is the spinal column? What does it connect and form? Joints of the vertebræ? Amount of motion? Result?</div>
  <p><b>11. The Spinal Column.</b>&mdash;The spinal column is often spoken
  of as the "back-bone," as if it were a single bone, while, in reality, it
  is composed of a chain of twenty-six small bones, called <i>vertebræ</i>.
  The spinal column is a wonderful piece of mechanism. It not only connects
  the important cavities of the body, as has already been shown, but, also,
  itself forms a canal, which contains the spinal cord. The joints of the
  vertebræ are remarkable for the thick layers of cartilage which separate
  the adjacent surfaces of bone. The amount of motion between any two of
  these bones is not great; but these little movements, taken together,
  admit of very considerable flexibility, in several directions, without
  endangering the supporting power of the column.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 6&mdash;The Spinal Column.</span>
  </div>

  <p><b>12.</b> The abundant supply of intervertebral cartilage has another
  important use, namely, it adds greatly to the elasticity of the frame. It
  is due, in part, to this elastic material, and in part to the frequent
  curves of the spine, that the brain and other delicate organs are
  protected from the shock of sudden falls or jars. During the day, the
  constant pressure upon these joints, while the body is erect, diminishes
  the thickness of the cartilages; so that a person is not so tall in the
  evening as in the morning. The effects of this compression pass away when
  the body reclines in a horizontal position.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>13.</b> Change in bone? Example&mdash;animal and madder. Rapidity of change in color? Waste and repair?</div>
  <p><b>13. The Growth of Bone.</b>&mdash;Bone, like all the other tissues
  of the body, is constantly undergoing change, old material being
  withdrawn, and new particles taking their place. This has been shown
  conclusively by experiments. If an animal be fed with madder&mdash;a red
  coloring matter&mdash;for a day or two, the bones soon become tinged;
  then, if the madder be discontinued for a few days, the original color
  returns. If, however, this material be alternately given and withheld, at
  short intervals, the bone will be marked by a succession of red and white
  rings. In very young animals, all the bones become colored in a single
  day; in older ones, a longer time is required. The process of waste and
  repair, therefore, is constantly taking place in this hard substance, and
  with astonishing rapidity. <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page23"></a>{23}</span></p>

  <p><b>14. The Repair of Bone.</b>&mdash;Nature's provision for uniting
  broken bones is very complete. At first, blood is poured out around the
  ends of the bone, as a result of the injury. This is gradually absorbed,
  and gives place to a watery fluid, which, thickening from day to day,
  acquires, at the end of two weeks, the consistency of jelly. This begins
  to harden, by a deposit of new bone-substance, until, at the expiration
  of five or six weeks, the broken bone may be said to be united. It is,
  however, still fragile, and must be used carefully a few weeks longer.
  The process of hardening continues, and months must pass before the union
  can be said to be complete.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>1.</b> What are the muscles? Their number? The design of most of them? Of a few?</div>
  <p><b>1. The Muscles.</b>&mdash; The great mass of the body external to
  the skeleton, is composed of the flesh, or <i>Muscles</i>, which largely
  determines its outline and weight. The muscles are the organs of motion.
  Their number is about four hundred, and to each of them is assigned a
  separate and distinct office. They have all been studied, one by one, and
  a name given to each, by the anatomist. Each is attached to bones which
  it is designed to move. A few are circular in form, and enclose cavities,
  the size of which they diminish by contraction.</p>

  </div>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>2.</b> The structure of flesh? Its color, etc.? The composition of the fibres? How marked?</div>
  <p><b>2.</b> If we examine a piece of flesh, we observe that it is soft,
  and of a deep red color. Its structure appears to be composed of layers
  and bundles of small fibres. Let us further examine these fibres under
  the microscope. We now discover that they are, in turn, made up of still
  finer fibres, of <i>fibrillæ</i>: these are seen in Fig. 8. The fibres
  are beautifully <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page26"></a>{26}</span>marked by parallel wavy lines, about ten
  thousand to an inch, which give the fibre its name of the <i>striped</i>
  muscular fibre. All of the voluntary muscles present this appearance.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>3.</b> Arrangement of the muscles? Their action? Flexion and extension? Action of the muscles when we stand erect?</div>
  <p><b>3. Flexion and Extension.</b>&mdash;The muscles are, for the most
  part, so arranged in pairs, or corresponding sets, that when motion is
  produced in one direction by one set, there is, opposite to it, another
  muscle, or group of muscles, which brings the limb back to its place.
  When they act alternately, a to-and-fro movement results. When a joint is
  bent, the motion is called <i>flexion</i>; and when it is made straight
  again, it is called <i>extension</i>. When both sets act equally, and at
  the same moment, no motion is produced, but the body or limb is
  maintained in a fixed position: this occurs when we stand erect. The
  muscles which produce extension are more powerful than those opposite to
  them.</p>

  <p><b>4.</b> The muscles are also distinguished, on the other hand, as
  the voluntary and involuntary muscles, according as they are, or are not,
  under the control of the will. The heart is an example of the involuntary
  variety. We cannot change its action in the least by an effort of the
  will. When we sleep, and the will ceases to act, the heart continues to
  beat without cessation. The voluntary muscles, on the other hand, are
  such as are used only when we wish or <i>will</i> to use them&mdash;as
  the muscles of the hand or arm (Fig. 9).</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>5.</b> What are the tendons or sinews? Their strength? Color? Location? Tendon of Achilles? The fable? Muscles of the leg?</div>
  <p><b>5. The Tendons.</b>&mdash;Tendons, or sinews, are the extremities
  of muscles, and are compactly fastened upon bone. They are very strong,
  and of a silvery whiteness. They may be felt just beneath the skin, in
  certain parts of the body, when the muscles are being used, as at the
  bend of the elbow or knee. The largest tendon of the body is that which
  is inserted into the heel, called the tendon of Achilles, after the hero
  of the Grecian poet, the fable relating that it was at this point that he
  received his death-wound, no other part of his body being vulnerable. The
  muscles which extend into the leg unite to form a single and very
  powerful tendon, and enclose a small bone called the knee-pan, which,
  acting like a pulley, greatly increases their power, and at the same time
  protects the front of the knee-joint (Fig. 10).</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>6.</b> Contraction of the muscles? Bending of the arm or finger? Other agencies? Automatic movements? In cold-blooded animals?</div>
  <p><b>6. Muscular Contraction.</b>&mdash;The muscles, when acted upon by
  the appropriate stimulus, contract, or so change <!-- Page 28 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>{28}</span>their shape, that their
  extremities are brought nearer together. The bending of the arm, or of a
  finger, is effected in this manner, by the will; but the will is not the
  only means of producing this effect. Electricity, a sharp blow over a
  muscle, and other stimuli, also cause it. Contraction does not always
  cease with life. In man, after death from cholera, automatic movements of
  hands and feet have been observed, lasting not less than an hour. In
  certain cold-blooded animals, as the turtle, contraction has been known
  to take place for several days after the head has been cut off.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>7.</b> Contractility? Give the illustration. What was supposed? What is the case?</div>
  <p><b>7.</b> The property which, in muscle, enables these movements to
  take place is called <i>contractility</i>. If we grasp a muscle while in
  exercise (for example, the large muscle in the front of the arm), we
  notice the alternate swelling and decrease of the muscle, as we move the
  forearm to and fro. It was at one time supposed that the muscle actually
  increased in volume during contraction. This, however, is not the case;
  for the muscle, while gaining in thickness, loses in length in the same
  proportion; and thus, the volume remains the same in action and at
  rest.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>8.</b> What further in relation to contraction? Weariness of a muscle? Beating of the heart? Standing and walking?</div>
  <p><b>8.</b> Contraction is not the permanent, or normal, state of a
  muscle. It cannot long remain contracted, but after a shorter or longer
  time, it wearies and is obliged to relax. After a short rest, it can then
  again contract. It is for this reason that the heart can beat all through
  life, night and day, by having, as we shall hereafter see, a brief
  interval of rest between successive pulsations. For the same reason, it
  is more fatiguing to stand for any great length of time in one position,
  than to be walking the same period.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>9.</b> Muscular power of animals? How tested? Man's power? Horse's? The comparison?</div>
  <p><b>9. Relative Strength of Animals.</b>&mdash;The amount of muscular
  power which different animals can exert, has <!-- Page 29 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>{29}</span>been tested by
  experiment. By determining the number of pounds which an animal can drag
  upon a level surface, and afterward comparing that with its own weight,
  we can judge of its muscular force. It is found that man is able to drag
  a little less than his own weight. A draught-horse can exert a force
  equal to about two-thirds of his weight. The horse, therefore, though
  vastly heavier than man, is relatively not so powerful.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>10.</b> Power of insects? Beetles? Give the conclusion.</div>
  <p><b>10.</b> Insects are remarkable for their power of carrying objects
  larger and heavier than themselves. Many of them can drag ten, and even
  twenty times their weight. Some of the beetles have been known to move
  bodies more than forty times their own weight. So far, therefore, from it
  being a fact that animals have strength in proportion to their weight and
  bulk, the reverse of that statement seems to be the law.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>11.</b> Difference in strength of individuals? How caused?</div>
  <p><b>11. Physical Strength.</b>&mdash;The difference in strength, as
  seen in different individuals, is not due to any original difference in
  their muscles. Nature gives essentially the same kind and amount of
  muscles to each person, and the power of one, or the weakness of another,
  arises, in great part, from the manner in which these organs are used or
  disused.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>12.</b> Complaint in relation to degeneracy? How true? How determined by armor? The fair supposition?</div>
  <p><b>12.</b> Many authors complain of the physical degeneracy of men at
  the present day, as compared with past generations. There is room for
  doubt as to the correctness of this statement. Certain experiments have
  recently been made with the metallic armor worn seven hundred years ago,
  by which it is found that any man, of ordinary height and muscular
  development, can carry the armor and wield the weapons of an age supposed
  to be greatly our superior in strength. When we consider that in those
  days, only very strong men could endure the hardships of soldier-life,
  <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>{30}</span>it
  is fair to suppose that our age has not so greatly degenerated in respect
  to physical strength.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>13</b> Action? Use of organs? Training of the mind? The child's brain? Education of the body?</div>
  <p><b>13. Importance of Exercise.</b>&mdash;Action is the law of the
  living body. Every organ demands use to preserve it in full vigor, and to
  obtain from it its best services. The value of that training of the mind,
  which we call education, is everywhere recognized. The child is early put
  to school, and for many years continues to study, in order that his
  brain, which is the great centre of mental power, may act healthfully and
  with force. It is important that the body, also, should receive its
  education by exercise. This is especially true of persons belonging to
  certain classes of society, whose occupation confines them within doors,
  and requires chiefly brain-work.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>14</b> Work in the open air? A perfect business? The consequence of universal perfect business? Occupation of children?</div>
  <p><b>14.</b> Persons who are engaged in manual labor in the open air
  obtain all the exercise necessary for bodily health in their regular
  business: their need is more likely to be a discipline or exercise of the
  mind. A perfect business of life, therefore, would be one which would
  combine both physical and mental labor in their proper proportions. If
  such a business were possible for all the human race, life would thereby
  be vastly prolonged. Such is, in fact, to a large extent, the occupation
  pertaining to one period of life&mdash;childhood. A part of the time is
  spent by the child in improving his mind by study, and another part of
  the time he has physical exercise in his games and sports.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>15</b> In what does exercise consist? Effects of it?</div>
  <p><b>15. The Effects of Exercise.</b>&mdash;Exercise consists in a
  well-regulated use of the voluntary muscular system. The effects,
  however, are not limited to the parts used. Other organs, which are not
  under the control of the will, are indirectly influenced by it. For
  instance, the heart beats more rapidly, the skin acts more freely, and
  <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page31"></a>{31}</span>becomes hotter, as well as the parts beneath
  it, and the appetite and power of digestion are increased. An increased
  exhalation from the lungs and skin purifies the current of the
  circulation, and the body as a whole thrives under its influence.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>16.</b> General effect upon the muscles? Special effect? Effects of inaction? Of excessive exercise?</div>
  <p><b>16.</b> The immediate effect of exercise, however, is upon the
  muscles themselves; for by use they become firm and large, and increase
  in power. If we examine a muscle thus improved by exercise, we find that
  its fibres have become larger and more closely blended together, that its
  color is of a darker red, and that the supply of blood-vessels has
  increased. Without exercise the muscle appears thin, flabby, and pale. On
  the other hand, excessive exercise, without sufficient relaxation,
  produces in the muscle a condition not very different from that which
  follows disuse. The muscle is worn out faster than nature builds it up,
  and it becomes flabby, pale, and weak.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>17.</b> Of violent and spasmodic efforts? Strength, how attained? Give the particulars.</div>
  <p><b>17.</b> Violent exercise is not beneficial; and spasmodic efforts
  to increase the muscular strength are not calculated to secure such a
  result. Strength is the result of a gradual growth, and is most surely
  acquired if the exercise be carried to a point short of fatigue, and
  after an adequate interval of rest. To gain the most beneficial results,
  the exercise should be at regular hours, and during a regular period. The
  activity of the exercise, and the time devoted to it must vary, of
  course, with the strength of the individual, and should be carefully
  measured by it.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>18.</b> What may walking be called? What further is said of walking?</div>
  <p><b>18. Different Modes of Exercise.</b>&mdash;There are very few who
  have not the power to walk. There is required for it no expensive
  apparatus, nor does it demand a period of preliminary training.
  <i>Walking may be called the universal exercise.</i> With certain foreign
  nations, the English <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>{32}</span>especially, it is a very popular exercise,
  and is practised habitually by almost every class of society; by the
  wealthy as well as by those who have no carriages; by women as well as by
  men.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>19.</b> What is said of running, and other like movements? What, as related to childhood? What instances are alluded to? Example?</div>
  <p><b>19.</b> Running, leaping, and certain other more rapid and violent
  movements, are the forms of exercise that are most enjoyed in childhood.
  For the child, they are not too severe, but they may be so prolonged as
  to become injurious. Instances have been recorded where sudden death has
  resulted after violent playing, from overtaxing the heart: for example,
  we have the case of a young girl who, while skipping the rope, and
  endeavoring to excel her playmates by jumping the greatest number of
  times, fell dead from rupture of the heart.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>20.</b> Carriage-riding? Horseback-riding?</div>
  <p><b>20.</b> Carriage-riding, as a means of passive exercise, is
  particularly well suited to invalids, and persons advanced in life.
  Horseback exercise brings into use a greater number of muscles than any
  other one exercise, and with it there is an exhilaration of feeling which
  refreshes the mind at the same time. It is one of the manliest of
  exercises, but not less suitable for women than for men. To be skilful in
  riding, it is best to begin its practice in youth; but there are very few
  kinds of exercise of which the same is not equally true.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>21.</b> Boating, swimming, and skating?</div>
  <p><b>21.</b> For those who live near streams or bodies of water, there
  are the delightful recreations of boating, swimming, and skating. Certain
  of these exercises have a practical importance aside from and above their
  use in increasing the physical vigor. This is especially true of boating
  and swimming, since they are often the means of saving life. Practice in
  these exercises also teaches self-reliance, courage, and presence of
  mind. Persons who have become proficient in these vigorous exercises are
  generally the ones, <!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page33"></a>{33}</span>who, in times of danger, are the quickest to
  act and the most certain to do so with judgment.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>22.</b> What kind of exercise yields the best results? What advice is given?</div>
  <p><b>22. Physical Culture.</b>&mdash;That form of exercise which
  interests and excites the mind, will yield the best results; but to some
  persons no kind of exertion whatever is, at first, agreeable. They
  should, nevertheless, make a trial of some exercise, in the expectation
  that, as they become proficient in it, it will become more pleasant. In
  exercise, as many sets of muscles should be employed as possible,
  open-air exercise being the best. Parlor gymnastics, and the discipline
  of the gymnasium are desirable, but they should not be the sole reliance
  for physical culture. No in-door exercise, however excellent in itself,
  can fill the place of hearty and vigorous activity in the open air.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>23.</b> Physical culture among the ancients? In Greece? In schools and colleges at the present time? Result to the body and mind?</div>
  <p><b>23. Gymnastic Exercises for Schools and Colleges.</b>&mdash;In the
  system of education among the ancients, physical culture predominated. In
  ancient Greece, physical exercises in schools were prescribed and
  regulated by law, and hence these schools were called <i>gymnasia</i>. At
  the present time, on the contrary, this culture is almost wholly unknown,
  as a part of the course of education, in our schools and colleges. In a
  few of our institutions of learning, however, physical exercises have
  been introduced, with manifest advantage to the students, and they form a
  part of the regular curriculum of exercises,&mdash;as much so as the
  recitations in geography, grammar, or Greek. The good effect of the
  experiments, as shown in improved scholarship as well as increased bodily
  vigor, in the institutions where the plan has been tried, will, it is
  hoped, lead to its universal adoption. We should then hear less
  frequently of parents being obliged to withdraw their children from
  school, because they become exhausted <!-- Page 34 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>{34}</span>or, perchance, have lost
  their health from intense and protracted mental application.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>24.</b> The result of gymnastics in our colleges and other institutions of learning?</div>
  <p><b>24.</b> Were gymnastics more common in our educational institutions
  we should not so often witness the sad spectacle of young men and women
  leaving our colleges and seminaries, with finished educations it may be,
  but with constitutions so impaired, that the life which should be devoted
  to the accomplishment of noble purposes must be spent in search of
  health. Spinal curvatures, which, according to the experience of
  physicians, are now extremely frequent, especially among ladies, would
  give place to the steady gait and erect carriage which God designed his
  human creatures should maintain.</p>

  <p><b>25.</b> All the exercises necessary for the proper development of
  the body may be obtained from the use of a few simple contrivances that
  every one can have at home, at little cost&mdash;less by far than is
  spent for useless toys. Many of these may be made available in the parlor
  or chamber, though all exercises are far more useful in the open air. A
  small portion of the day thus spent will afford agreeable recreation as
  well as useful exercise. The Indian club, the wand, the ring, and the
  dumb-bells answer ordinary purposes very well. Illustrations are here
  introduced of a few simple contrivances that may be useful for general
  exercises, and are specially suitable for persons with <i>weak
  spines</i>, or with spines that are the subject of lateral curvature.</p>

  <p><b>26.</b> One of the simplest appliances for strengthening the
  muscles of the spine, designed chiefly to exercise the muscles on either
  side of the spine, consists of two wooden handles attached to
  india-rubber cords, one of which is attached to a hook made fast in the
  ceiling, or in the top of the door-case; and the other to another hook
  fastened in the wall, door-post, or window-casing, about the height <!--
  Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>{35}</span>of the
  shoulder. When traction is made with the left hand, it exercises the
  muscles on the left side of the spine, while those on the opposite side
  are left almost at rest, owing to the oblique direction given to the
  shoulders when the right hand grasps the horizontal cord. (This appliance
  will be understood by referring to Fig. 13.)</p>

  <p><b>27.</b> Fig. 11 shows an appliance consisting of two strong elastic
  cords, with handles, secured to a hook in the floor, so arranged that the
  patient has to stoop forward to reach them. On raising the body the
  spinal muscles are powerfully exercised. Fig. 12 shows other modes of
  using the elastic cords for strengthening the spine and chest.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 13.</span>
  </div>

  <p><b>28.</b> These various appliances have been combined so as to form a
  system of gymnastics suitable for parlor use; other appliances have been
  added by which the muscles of <!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page37"></a>{37}</span>the legs may be called into action as well
  as those of the spine and upper part of the body (Fig. 13). Combinations
  of cords suitable for particular cases may also be made, and by using one
  or several cords on the same hook, their power may be adapted to the
  strength of the most robust as well as to that of the invalid, or of the
  most delicate child. The entire apparatus is quite simple in its
  construction and inexpensive, requiring but little space, and at the same
  time affording a great variety of exercises.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Exercises that may be Practised on this Apparatus.</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><span class="sc">Exercise I.</span> (Fig. 13).&mdash;Stand erect under
  the cords and place the heels together. Grasp the handles firmly, keeping
  the knees and elbows stiff, and pull downward and forward until the
  fingers nearly touch the toes. Return slowly to the erect position.
  Repeat.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Exercise II.</span> (Fig. 13).&mdash;Stand erect, and
  having grasped the handles overhead firmly, separate them and bring them
  down slowly until they touch the sides: then return them slowly to the
  original position. Repeat.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Exercise III.</span> (Fig. 13).&mdash;Stand erect,
  heels together, grasp the handles overhead, and charge forward with the
  right foot. Return to first position, and then charge with the left.
  Repeat, using the right and left foot alternately.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Exercise IV.</span> (Fig. 13).&mdash;Stand erect,
  heels together. Grasp the handle overhead, and charge forward with the
  right foot, knee bent. Remain in this position and bring the arms down to
  the sides so that the arm and fore-arm may form a right angle. Still
  holding the handles, thrust forward, first the right hand and then the
  left, until the arm is straight. Repeat. Return to first position, then
  charge forward with the left foot, performing the same movements as
  before.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Exercise V.</span> (Fig. 13).&mdash;In this exercise
  we change to the pulleys leading from the side posts, which can be used
  in several different ways. 1st. Stand erect, heels together, facing one
  of the posts, grasp the handle with the right hand, the arm being
  extended, then flex the fore-arm on the arm. Repeat. Perform the same
  movements with the left hand. 2d. Stand with back to the post; grasp the
  pulley behind with the right hand, then gradually bring the hand forward
  until it is extended in a straight line in front. Repeat. Perform the
  same exercise with the left hand.</p>

<p><!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Exercise VI.</span> (Fig. 13).&mdash;This exercise is
  especially adapted to the legs. Stirrups are so arranged that they can be
  attached to the pulleys overhead, and can hang down to within three or
  four feet of the floor. Place the foot in the stirrup, and then press
  down until it touches the floor. Repeat. Exercise the left foot in the
  same way.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Exercise VII.</span> (Fig. 13.)&mdash;This exercise
  requires a little attention in the adjustment of the apparatus. Under the
  pulleys in the floor are passed ropes which can be attached to the
  snap-hooks that hold the handles overhead. Stoop forward with the knees
  stiff, and take hold of the handles, and then raise the body to the erect
  position. Repeat.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Exercise VIII.</span> (Fig. 13).&mdash;Sit on the
  floor or on a seat three or four inches high; bend forward, take hold of
  the handles, and perform the same movements that you would in rowing a
  boat.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Exercise IX.</span> (Fig. 13).&mdash;The trapeze can
  now be let down; take hold of it with both hands, sustaining the weight
  of the body with the arms, then rotate the body first from right to left,
  then from left to right alternately. This exercise is especially suitable
  for females.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Exercise X.</span> (Fig. 13).&mdash;Grasp the trapeze
  as before, bearing all the weight with the arms: then draw the body up
  slowly until you can place the chin over the bars. This requires strength
  of muscle, and might strain if done too violently; if slowly performed
  there is no danger.</p>

  <p>These are but a few of the exercises that can be practised with this
  apparatus. As these become familiar they can easily be modified, and new
  ones can be arranged to meet the requirements of particular cases. Most
  of the exercises described can be practised with one hand so as to
  strengthen the muscles on one side.</p>

</blockquote>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>29.</b> Need of repose? How do we obtain rest? Alfred the Great? The eight-hour division of time?</div>
  <p><b>29. Rest.</b>&mdash;We cannot always be active: repose must succeed
  labor. We obtain this rest partly by suspending all exertion, as in
  sleep, and partly by a change of employment. It is said that Alfred the
  Great recommended that each day should be divided in the following
  manner: "Eight hours for work, eight hours for recreation, and eight
  hours for sleep." This division of time is as good as any that could now
  be made, if it be borne in mind that, when the work is physical, the time
  of recreation should <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page39"></a>{39}</span>be devoted to the improvement of the mind;
  and when mental, we should then recreate by means of physical
  exercise.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>30.</b> Cessation of voluntary activity? Temperature of the body? Consequence? Body and mind during sleep? Nutrition? Describe it. Consequences of insufficient sleep?</div>
  <p><b>30.</b> During sleep, all voluntary activity ceases, the rapidity
  of the circulation and breathing diminishes, and the temperature of the
  body falls one or two degrees. In consequence, the body needs warmer
  coverings than during the hours of wakefulness. During sleep, the body
  seems wholly at rest, and the mind is also inactive, if we except those
  involuntary mental wanderings which we call dreams. Nevertheless a very
  active and important physical process is going on. Nutrition, or the
  nourishing of the tissues, now takes place. While the body is in action,
  the process of pulling down predominates, but in sleep, that of building
  up takes place more actively. In this way we are refreshed each night,
  and prepared for the work and pleasures of another day. If sleep is
  insufficient, the effects are seen in the lassitude and weakness which
  follow. Wakefulness is very frequently the forerunner of insanity,
  especially among those who perform excessive mental labor.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>31.</b> Amount of sleep in different persons? Cases? Frederick the Great? Bonaparte? Instances of long deprivation of sleep?</div>
  <p><b>31.</b> All persons do not require the same amount of sleep, but
  the average of men need from seven to nine hours. There are
  well-authenticated cases where individuals have remained without sleep
  for many days without apparent injury. Frederick the Great required only
  five hours of sleep daily. Bonaparte could pass days with only a few
  hours of rest. But this long continued absence of sleep is attended with
  danger. After loss of sleep for a long period, in some instances, stupor
  has come on so profoundly, that there has been no awaking.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>32.</b> Instances of sailors? French soldiers? During torture?</div>
  <p><b>32.</b> There are instances related of sailors falling asleep <!--
  Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>{40}</span>on the
  gun-decks of their ships while in action. On the retreat from Moscow, the
  French soldiers would fall asleep on the march, and could only be aroused
  by the cry, "The Cossacks are coming!" Tortured persons are said to have
  slept upon the rack in the intervals of their torture. In early life,
  while engaged in a laborious country practice, the writer not
  unfrequently slept soundly on horseback. These instances, and others,
  show the imperative demand which nature makes for rest in sleep.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">The Integument, or Skin.</span></h3>

  <p><i>The Integument&mdash;Its Structure&mdash;The Nails and
  Hair&mdash;The Complexion&mdash;The Sebaceous Glands&mdash;The
  Perspiratory Glands&mdash;Perspiration and its Uses&mdash;Importance of
  Bathing&mdash;Different kinds of Baths&mdash;Manner of Bathing&mdash;The
  Benefits of the Sun&mdash;Importance of Warm Clothing&mdash;Poisonous
  Cosmetics.</i></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>1.</b> What is the skin? Parts directly beneath? What is shown?</div>
  <p><b>1. The Integument.</b>&mdash;The skin is the outer covering of the
  body. The parts directly beneath it are very sensitive, and require
  protection. This is shown whenever by accident the skin is broken,
  pierced, or torn off, the bared surface being very tender, and painful to
  the touch. Nature has provided the body with a garment that is soft,
  pliable, close-fitting, and very thin, and yet sufficiently strong to
  enable us to come in contact with the objects that surround us, without
  inconvenience or suffering.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>2.</b> Microscopic examination? What is the cutis? The cuticle? Their union? How separated? What further is said of the cuticle?</div>
  <p><b>2. The Structure of the Skin.</b>&mdash;When examined with the aid
  of the microscope, the skin is found to be made up of two
  layers&mdash;the outer and the inner. The inner one is called the
  <i>cutis</i>, or true skin; the outer one is the <i>epidermis</i>, or
  scarf-skin. The latter is also known as the <i>cuticle</i>. These two
  layers are closely united, but they may be separated from each other.
  This separation takes place whenever, from a burn, or other cause, a
  blister is formed; a watery fluid is poured out between the two layers,
  and lifts the epidermis from the true skin.</p>

  <p>Of the two layers, the cuticle is the thinner in most parts of the
  body, and has the appearance of a whitish membrane. It is tough and
  elastic, is without feeling, and does <!-- Page 42 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>{42}</span>not bleed, when cut.
  Examine it more closely, and we observe that it is composed of minute
  flat cells, closely compacted, and arranged layer upon layer.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>3.</b> Wearing out of the cuticle? What then? Variety in thickness of cuticle? How accounted for?</div>
  <p><b>3.</b> The outer layer is constantly being worn out, and falls from
  the body in the form of very fine scales. It is, also, continually
  forming anew on the surface of the inner layer. Its thickness varies in
  different parts of the body. Where exposed to use, it is thick, hard, and
  horn-like, as may be seen on the soles of the feet, or on the palms of
  the hands, especially of those who are accustomed to perform much manual
  labor. This is an admirable provision for the increased protection of the
  sensitive parts below the skin against all extraordinary exposure. Even
  the <i>liabilities</i> of these parts to injury, are thus kindly provided
  for by "the Hand that made us."</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>4.</b> Location and office of the cutis? What further is said of it? Papillæ? Touch?</div>
  <p><b>4.</b> The cutis, or true skin, lies beneath the epidermis, and is
  its origin and support. It is firm, dense, elastic, very sensitive, and
  is freely supplied with blood-vessels. It is closely connected with the
  tissues below it, but may be separated by means of a sharp instrument.
  The surface of the cutis is not smooth, but is covered here and there
  with minute elevations, called <i>papillæ</i>. These are arranged in
  rows, along fine lines, or ridges, such as those which mark the palm and
  fingers; their number is about 80 to the square line (a line being
  one-twelfth of an inch). These <i>papillæ</i> contain the blood-vessels
  which carry the supply of blood needed by the ever-wasting skin. They
  contain nerves also, and are largely concerned in the sense of touch;
  hence they are particularly abundant where the touch is most delicate, as
  at the ends of the fingers.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>5.</b> What are the nails and hair? The growth of the nail? The rapidity of its growth? Accident to the nail?</div>
<p><!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>{43}</span></p>

    Hair.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p><b>5. The Nails and Hair.</b>&mdash;These are appendages of the skin,
  and although very unlike the cuticle as it appears on the surface of the
  body, they are, in reality, modified forms of that layer of the skin. The
  nail grows from a fold of the cuticle at the root, and from the under
  surface. As fast as it is formed, it is constantly being pushed outward.
  The rapidity of its growth can be ascertained by filing a slight groove
  on its surface, and noticing how the space between it and the root of the
  nail increases, in the course of a few weeks. When the nail is removed by
  any accident, it will be replaced by a new one, if the root be not
  injured.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>6.</b> How are the hairs produced? Difference in their length?</div>
  <p><b>6.</b> The hairs are produced in a similar manner; the skin forming
  depressions, or hair sacs, from the bottom of which they grow and are
  nourished (Fig. 14). They are found, of greater or less length, on almost
  all parts of the surface, except the palms of the hands and soles of the
  feet. On certain parts of the body, they grow to great length; on other
  parts they are so short, that they do not rise beyond the hair sac in
  which they originate.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>7.</b> Root of the hair? Shaft? Firmness and softness of the hair?</div>
  <p><b>7.</b> The bulb, or root, from which the hair arises, is lodged in
  a small pouch, or depression in the skin. The shaft is the part which
  grows out beyond the level of the skin. Its growth is altogether in one
  direction, in length alone. The outer part of the hair is quite firm,
  while its <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page44"></a>{44}</span>interior is softer, and probably conveys the
  fluids by which it is nourished. The hair is more glossy in health than
  at other times.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>8.</b> Office of the nail? Of the hair? Give the illustrations.</div>
  <p><b>8.</b> The nail serves as a protection to the end of the finger,
  and also enables us to grasp more firmly, and to pick up small objects.
  The hair, too, is a protection to the parts it covers. On the head, it
  shields the brain from extremes of heat and cold, and moderates the force
  of blows upon the scalp. On the body, it is useful in affording a more
  extensive surface for carrying off the perspiration.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>9.</b> On what does the complexion depend? Light and dark races? Freckles?</div>
  <p><b>9. Complexion.</b>&mdash;In the deeper cells of the cuticle lies a
  pigment, or coloring matter, consisting of minute colored grains. On this
  pigment <i>complexion</i> depends; and, according as it is present in
  less or greater amount, occasions the difference of hue, that exists
  between the light and dark races of men, and between the blonde and
  brunette of the white races. Freckles are due to an irregular increase of
  coloring matter.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>10.</b> Influence of the sun? How illustrated? Jews?</div>
  <p><b>10.</b> The sun has a powerful influence over the development of
  this pigment, as is shown by the swarthy hue of those of the white race
  who have colonized in tropical climates. It is also well illustrated by
  the fact, that among the Jews who have settled in northern Europe, there
  are many who are fair complexioned, while those residing in India, are as
  dark as the Hindoos around them.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>11.</b> What is an Albino? Where are Albinos found?</div>
  <p><b>11.</b> An Albino is a person who may be said to have no
  complexion; that is, there is an entire absence of coloring matter from
  the skin, hair, and <i>iris</i> of the eye. This condition more
  frequently occurs among the dark races, and in hot climates, although it
  has been observed in almost every race and clime.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>12.</b> What are sebaceous glands? How do they act? Sebaceous glands of the face? How do they act?</div>
  <p><b>12. Sebaceous Glands.</b>&mdash;There are in the skin certain <!--
  Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>{45}</span>small
  glands, which produce an oily substance, called <i>sebaceous</i> matter.
  These glands are little rounded sacs, usually connected with the
  hair-bulbs; and upon these bulbs, they empty their product of oil, which
  acts as a natural and adequate dressing for the hair (4, <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'Fig. 13'.">Fig. 14</span>). A
  portion of the sebaceous matter passes out upon the surface, and prevents
  the cuticle from becoming dry and hard. The glands situated upon the face
  and forehead, open directly upon the skin. In these, the sebaceous matter
  is liable to collect, and become too hard to flow off naturally.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>13.</b> Black points, called worms? Animalcules? Service performed by sebaceous matter?</div>
  <p><b>13.</b> These glands on the face and forehead frequently appear, on
  the faces of the young, as small black points, which are incorrectly
  called "worms." It is true, that occasionally living animalcules are
  found in this thickened sebaceous matter, but they can only be detected
  by the aid of the microscope. This sebaceous matter acts not only to keep
  the skin flexible, and furnish for the hair an oily dressing, but it
  especially serves to protect the skin and hair, from the acridity arising
  from the perspiration.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>14.</b> Perspiration? Sweat glands? Of what do they consist? Dimension of the tubes?</div>
  <p><b>14. The Perspiratory Glands.</b>&mdash;The chief product of the
  skin's action is the perspiration. For the formation of this, there are
  furnished countless numbers of little sweat-glands in the true skin. They
  consist of fine tubes, with globe-like coils at their deeper extremity.
  Their mouths or openings may be seen with an ordinary magnifying glass,
  upon the fine ridges which mark the fingers. These tubes, if uncoiled,
  measure about one-tenth of an inch in length. In diameter, they are about
  one three-hundredth of an inch, and upon certain parts of the body there
  are not far from three thousand of these glands to the square inch. Their
  whole number in the body is, therefore, very great; and, in fact, it is
  computed if they were all united, end to end, their combined measurement
  would exceed three miles. <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page46"></a>{46}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>15.</b> What is sensible perspiration? Insensible perspiration?</div>
  <p><b>15. The Sensible and Insensible Perspiration.</b>&mdash;The pores
  of the skin are constantly exhaling a watery fluid; but, under ordinary
  circumstances, there is no moisture apparent upon the surface, for it
  evaporates as rapidly as it is formed. This is called insensible
  perspiration. Under the influence of heat or exercise, however, this
  fluid is excreted more abundantly, and appears on the surface in the form
  of minute, colorless drops. It is then termed sensible perspiration.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>16.</b> Components of perspiration? Upon what does perspiration depend? Amount of perspiration daily?</div>
  <p><b>16.</b> Water is the chief component of this fluid, there being
  about ninety-eight parts of water to two parts of solid matter. The
  quantity escaping from the body varies greatly, according to the
  temperature of the air, the occupation of the individual, and other
  circumstances. The average daily amount of this excretion, in the adult,
  is not far from thirty ounces, nearly two pints, or more than nine grains
  each minute.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>17.</b> What does perspiration set free from the blood? What other service does perspiration perform? Explain the process.</div>
  <p><b>17. The Uses of the Perspiration.</b>&mdash;Besides liberating from
  the blood this large amount of water, with the effete matter it contains,
  the perspiration serves to regulate the temperature of the body. That is
  to say, as evaporation always diminishes temperature, so the
  perspiration, as it passes off in the form of fine vapor, cools the
  surface. Accordingly, in hot weather this function is much more active,
  and the cooling influence increases in proportion. When the air is
  already charged with moisture, and does not readily receive this vapor of
  the body, the heat of the atmosphere apparently increases, and the
  discomfort therefrom is relatively greater.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>18.</b> Effect of interruption of excretion? What experiments are mentioned?</div>
  <p><b>18.</b> The importance of this excretion is shown by the effects
  that often follow its temporary interruption, namely, headache, fever,
  and the other symptoms that accompany <!-- Page 47 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>{47}</span>"taking cold." When the
  perspiration is completely checked, the consequences are very serious.
  Experiments have been performed upon certain smaller animals, as rabbits,
  to ascertain the results of closing the perspiratory tubes. When they are
  covered by a coating of varnish impervious to water and gases, death
  ensues in from six to twelve hours; the attendant symptoms resembling
  those of suffocation.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>19.</b> Give the story in relation to the boy covered with gold foil.</div>
  <p><b>19.</b> It is related that, at the coronation of one of the Popes
  about three hundred years ago, a little boy was chosen to act the part of
  an angel; and in order that his appearance might be as gorgeous as
  possible, he was covered from head to foot with a coating of gold foil.
  He was soon taken sick, and although every known means were employed for
  his recovery, except the removal of his fatal golden covering, he died in
  a few hours.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>20.</b> Give the quotation. Perspiration?</div>
  <p><b>20. The Importance of Bathing.</b>&mdash;From these considerations,
  it is evident that health must greatly depend upon the free action of the
  skin. "He who keeps the skin ruddy and soft, shuts many gates against
  disease." When the watery portion of the perspiration evaporates, the
  solid matter is left behind on the surface. There, also, remain the
  scales of the worn-out cuticle, and the excess of sebaceous matter. In
  order to secure the natural action of the skin, these impurities require
  to be removed by the frequent application of water.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>21.</b> Ablution in warm climates? What advice is given?</div>
  <p><b>21.</b> In warm climates, and during hot weather, ablution should
  be more frequently practised. For a person in good health, a daily cold
  bath is advisable. To this should be added occasionally a tepid bath,
  with soap, water alone not being sufficient to remove impurities of a
  greasy nature. Soap facilitates this, by forming with such substances a
  chemical mixture, which is readily soluble in water, and is by it removed
  from the body. <!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page48"></a>{48}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>22.</b> Liebig's maxim? What further is added?</div>
  <p><b>22.</b> There is a maxim by the chemist Liebig, to the effect, that
  the civilization of a nation is high, in proportion to the amount of soap
  that it consumes; and that it is low, in proportion to its use of
  perfumes. In some degree, we may apply the same test to the refinement of
  an individual. The soap removes impurity; the perfume covers, while
  retaining it.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>23.</b> What is said about cold bathing?</div>
  <p><b>23. The different kinds of Baths.</b>&mdash;All persons are not
  alike able to use the cold bath. When the health is vigorous, and the
  system does not feel a shock after such a bath, a prompt reaction and
  glow upon the surface will show that it is beneficial. Where this
  pleasurable feeling is not experienced, but rather a chill and sense of
  depression ensues, we are warned that the system will not, with impunity,
  endure cold bathing.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>24.</b> What is said about warm bathing?</div>
  <p><b>24.</b> It should also be borne in mind, that the warm or hot bath
  cannot be continued so long, or repeated so frequently as the cold, on
  account of the enervating effect of unusual heat so applied to the body.
  For persons who are not in robust health, one warm bath each week is
  sufficient; this class should be careful to avoid every extreme in
  reference to bathing, clothing, and whatever greatly affects the action
  of the skin.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>25.</b> What is said about sea-bathing?</div>
  <p><b>25.</b> Sea-bathing is even more invigorating than fresh-water
  bathing. Those who cannot endure the fresh water, are often benefited by
  the salt-water baths. This may be accounted for, in part, by the
  stimulant action upon the surface, of the saline particles of the
  sea-water; but the exciting scenes and circumstances of sea-bathing also
  exert an important influence. The open-air exercise, the rolling surf,
  the genial weather, and usually the cheerful company, add to its
  intrinsic benefits. <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page49"></a>{49}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>26.</b> What is said as to the time and manner of bathing?</div>
  <p><b>26. Time and Manner of Bathing.</b>&mdash;A person in sound health
  may take a bath at almost any time, except directly after a full meal.
  The most appropriate time is about three hours after a meal, the
  noon-hour being probably the best. For the cold bath, taken rapidly, no
  time is better than immediately after rising. Those beginning the use of
  cold baths should first try them at 70° Fahr., and gradually use those of
  a lower temperature. From five to twenty minutes may be considered the
  proper limit of time to remain in a bath; but a sensation of chilliness
  is a signal to withdraw instantly, whether at home, or at the sea-side.
  Two sea-baths may be taken daily; one of any other kind is
  sufficient.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>27.</b> Condition of the body when bathing? Direction, after bathing?</div>
  <p><b>27.</b> The body should be warm, rather than cold, when stepping
  into the bath; and after it, the skin should be thoroughly dried with a
  coarse towel. It is best to continue friction until there is a sensation
  of warmth or "glow" throughout the entire surface. This reaction is the
  test of the good effects of the bath. If reaction is still incomplete, a
  short walk may be taken, especially in the sunshine. It is very
  congenial, however, both to health and comfort, to rest for a short time
  directly after bathing, or to take some light refreshment. This is better
  than severe exercise or a full meal.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>28.</b> Bathing among the ancients? Baths of Rome?</div>
  <p><b>28. Bathing among the Ancients.</b>&mdash;The Romans and other
  nations of antiquity made great use of the vapor-bath as a means of
  preserving the health, but more particularly as a luxury. Their method
  was not unlike that employed in northern Europe at the present day. The
  public baths of Rome and other cities are among the grandest and most
  interesting monuments of ancient luxury and splendor; and from their
  ruins have been recovered some of the most beautiful works of art. <!--
  Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>{50}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>29.</b> After the bath? Swimming among the ancients?</div>
  <p><b>29.</b> The Thermæ, as the baths of Rome were called, were of great
  extent, built very substantially, and ornamented at vast expense. They
  were practically free to all, the cost of a bath having been less than a
  cent. It is related that some persons bathed seven times a day. After the
  bath their bodies were anointed with perfumed oil. If the weather was
  fine, they passed directly from the Thermæ into the gymnasium, and
  engaged in some gentle exercise previous to taking the midday meal.
  Between two and three in the afternoon was the favorite hour for this
  ancient luxury. Swimming was a favorite exercise, and a knowledge of it
  was regarded as necessary to every educated man. Their common expression,
  when speaking of an ignorant person, was, "He can neither read nor
  swim."</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>30.</b> The Sun-bath? The story of Pliny?</div>
  <p><b>30. The Sun-Bath.</b>&mdash;Some also were accustomed daily to
  anoint themselves, and lie or walk in apartments arranged for the
  purpose, with naked bodies exposed to the direct rays of the sun. There
  is an interesting allusion to this practice, in a letter of the younger
  Pliny to the historian Tacitus, describing the destruction of Pompeii by
  an eruption of Vesuvius. "My uncle," (Pliny the elder,) "was at that time
  in command of the fleet at Misenum. On the 24th of August, about one in
  the afternoon, my mother desired him to notice a cloud which seemed of
  unusual shape and dimensions. He had just returned from <i>taking the
  benefit of the sun</i>, and after a cold bath, and a slight repast, had
  retired to his study." Then follows a description of the destruction of
  Pompeii, and the death of the elder Pliny.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>31.</b> Benefit of the sun? Effect upon plants? Skin?</div>
  <p><b>31.</b> We may judge somewhat of "the benefits of the sun," by
  observing the unnatural and undeveloped condition of plants and animals
  which are deprived of light. Plants become blanched and tender; the fish
  of <!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page51"></a>{51}</span>subterranean lakes, where no light enters,
  are undersized, and have no eyes; tadpoles kept in the dark do not
  develop into frogs; men growing up in mines are sallow, pale, and
  deformed. Besides the well-known effect of solar light in tanning the
  skin, it also makes it thicker and better able to resist exposure; though
  the complexion may be thereby injured, the health gains more than
  compensate for the loss of beauty. "To make good the loss of the lily,
  where the sun has cast his ray, he seldom fails to plant the rose."</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>32.</b> Direction about clothing? Exposing limbs of children? Clothing, night and day?</div>
  <p><b>32. Clothing.</b>&mdash;In reference to clothing, we are far more
  apt, in our changeful climate, to use too little than too much. An
  aphorism of Boerhaave, worth remembering, if not of adopting, is, "We
  should put off our winter clothing on midsummer's day, and put it on
  again the day after." He also says, "Only fools and beggars suffer from
  the cold; the latter not being able to get sufficient clothes, the others
  not having the sense to wear them." The practice of exposing the limbs
  and necks of young children, for the alleged purpose of "hardening" them,
  is quite hazardous. It is not to be denied that some seem to be made
  tough by the process; but it is so only with the rugged children, the
  delicate ones will invariably suffer under this fanciful treatment. As
  has been stated before, the skin is constantly acting, by night as well
  as by day. It is therefore conducive both to cleanliness and comfort to
  change entirely the clothing on retiring for the night. The day-clothing
  should be aired during the night, and the bedding should be aired in the
  morning, for the same reason.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>33.</b> Cosmetics? Painters' colic?</div>
  <p><b>33. Poisonous Cosmetics.</b>&mdash;The extensive use of
  <i>cosmetics</i> for the complexion is a fertile source of disease. The
  majority of these preparations contain certain poisonous mineral
  substances, chiefly lead. Now, the skin rapidly absorbs the fine
  particles of lead, and the system <!-- Page 52 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span>experiences the same evil
  effects that are observed among the operatives in lead works and
  painters, namely, "painters' colic," and paralysis of the hands, called
  "wrist-drop."</p>

  <p><b>34.</b> Certain hair-dyes also contain lead, together with other
  noxious and filthy ingredients. These do not work as great harm as the
  cosmetics, since they are purposely kept away from the skin, but they rob
  the hair of its vitality. Eye-washes, too, are made from solutions of
  lead, and many an eye has been ruined by their use. They deposit a white
  metallic scale on the surface of the eye, which becomes a permanent
  obstruction to the vision.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">The Chemistry of Food.</span></h3>

  <p><i>The Source of Food&mdash;Inorganic
  Substances&mdash;Water&mdash;Salt&mdash;Lime&mdash;Iron&mdash;Organic
  Substances&mdash;Albumen, Fibrin, and Casein&mdash;The Fats or
  Oils&mdash;The Sugars, Starch, and Gum&mdash;Stimulating
  Substances&mdash;Necessity of a Regulated Diet.</i></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>1.</b> The term food? Source of food? Need of preparing food?</div>
  <p><b>1. The Source of Food.</b>&mdash;The term <i>food</i> includes all
  those substances, whether liquid or solid, which are necessary for the
  nourishment of the body. The original source of all food is the earth,
  which the poet has fitly styled the "Mother of all living." In her bosom,
  and in the atmosphere about her, are contained all the elements on which
  life depends. But man is unable to obtain nourishment directly from such
  crude chemical forms as he finds in the inorganic world. They must, with
  a few exceptions, be prepared for his use, by being transformed into new
  and higher combinations, more closely resembling the tissues of his own
  body.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>2.</b> Usefulness and hurtfulness of plants? What then must man do? Parts of the same plant or tree?</div>
  <p><b>2.</b> This transformation is effected, first, by the vegetable
  world. But all plants are not alike useful to man; while some are
  absolutely hurtful. Accordingly, he must learn to discriminate between
  that which is poisonous and that which is life-supporting. Again, all
  parts of the same plant or tree are not alike beneficial: in some, the
  fruit, in others, the leaves, and in others, the seeds only are
  sufficiently refined for his use. These he must learn to select; he must
  also learn the proper modes of preparing each kind for his table, whether
  by cooking or other processes. <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page54"></a>{54}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>3.</b> Certain forms of vegetable creation? Example of the bee? Cattle? The inference?</div>
  <p><b>3.</b> Again, certain forms of the vegetable creation which are
  unfit, in their crude state, for man's food, and which he rejects, are
  chosen as food by some of the lower animals, and are, by them, made ready
  for his use. Thus the bee takes the clover, that man cannot eat, and from
  it collects honey. The cattle eat the husks of corn and the dried grass,
  that are by far too coarse for man, and in their own flesh convert them
  into tissues closely resembling his muscular tissue. In this way, by the
  aid of the transforming processes of the vegetable and animal creations,
  the simple chemical elements of the mineral kingdom are elaborated into
  our choice articles of food.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>4.</b> What classification? Define organic substances. Inorganic. Organic, how spoken of? The inorganic? Water and salt?</div>
  <p><b>4. Inorganic Substances.</b>&mdash;The substances we use as food
  are classified as <i>organic</i> and <i>inorganic</i>. By organic
  substances are meant those derived from living forms, such as vegetables
  and animals. Inorganic substances are those simpler inanimate forms which
  belong to the mineral kingdom. The former alone are commonly spoken of as
  food, but the latter enter very largely into the constitution of the
  body, and must therefore be present in our food. With the exception of
  two articles, water and common salt, these substances only enter the
  system when blended with organic substances.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>5.</b> Water in physiology? Where found? Computation? Water in the teeth? Muscle, tendons, and ligaments? How ascertained? Water in the fluids of the body? What is the advantage?</div>
  <p><b>5. Water.</b>&mdash;Water, from a physiological point of view, is
  the most important of all the articles of food. It is everywhere found in
  the body, even in the bones and the teeth. It has been computed that as
  large a proportion as two-thirds of the body is water. The teeth, the
  densest of the solids in the human system, contain ten per cent. of
  water. The muscles, tendons, and ligaments are more than half water; for
  it is found that they lose more than half their <!-- Page 55 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>{55}</span>weight when dried with
  moderate heat. But it is in the <i>fluids</i> of the body that water is
  found most abundantly. It gives to them the power of holding a great
  variety of substances in solution, and is the great highway by which new
  supplies are conveyed to the point where they are required, and by which
  old particles of matter, that have served their uses, are brought to the
  outlets of the body to be thus removed from the system.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>6.</b> Length of time man can do without food or water? Give the comparison? Bulk of drinks? Constituent of meats, etc.? Fruits?</div>
  <p><b>6.</b> Man can remain a longer time without solid food than without
  water. He may be deprived of the former for ten to twelve hours without
  great suffering, but deprivation of water for the same length of time
  will produce both severe pain and great weakness. The food should contain
  not less than two parts of water to one of solid nutriment. Water
  constitutes the great bulk of all our drinks, and is also a large
  constituent of the meats, vegetables, and fruits which come upon the
  table. Fruits, especially, contain it in great abundance, and, in their
  proper season, furnish most agreeable and refreshing supplies of the
  needed fluid.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>7.</b> Salt, how obtained? Where found? In the human body? Importance of salt? What else can you state of the value of salt?</div>
  <p><b>7. Common Salt.</b>&mdash;Salt, or sodium chloride, as an article
  of food, is obtained chiefly from the mineral kingdom; although plants
  contain it in small quantities, and it is also found in the tissues of
  nearly all animals used as food. In the human body, it is an ingredient
  of all the solids and fluids. The importance of salt to animal life in
  general, is shown by the great appetite for it manifested by domestic
  animals, and also by the habitual resort of herds of wild beasts to the
  "salt-licks" or springs. In those parts of the world where salt is
  obtained with difficulty, man places a very high price upon it.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>8.</b> Experiments upon animals?</div>
  <p><b>8.</b> Experiments upon domestic animals show that the withdrawal
  of salt from their food, not only makes their <!-- Page 56 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>{56}</span>hides rough and causes
  the hair to fall out, but also interferes with the proper digestion of
  food. If it be withheld persistently, they become entirely unable to
  appropriate nourishment, and die of starvation.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>9.</b> Salt, how taken into the system? Its use in cooking? Consumption?</div>
  <p><b>9.</b> Salt is usually taken into the system in sufficient
  quantities in our food. Even the water we drink often has traces of it.
  The habitual use of much salt in cooking, or as a seasoning at the table,
  is not wise; and while it may not lead to consumption, as some writers
  declare, it is a bad habit in itself, and leads to the desire for other
  and more injurious condiments.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>10.</b> Lime in the bones? What does it impart? Chief ingredient of the bones and teeth? Where else found?</div>
  <p><b>10. Lime.</b>&mdash;This is the mineral substance which we have
  spoken of before as entering very largely into the composition of the
  bones. It is the important element which gives solidity and permanence to
  the framework upon which the body is built. Calcium tri-phosphate, or
  "bone-earth," is the chief ingredient of the bones and teeth, but is
  found in the cartilages and other parts of the body in smaller
  quantities.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>11.</b> How does lime find its way into the body? Early life? Effect of its derivation?</div>
  <p><b>11.</b> How does this substance find its way into the body? Meat,
  milk, and other articles obtained from the animal kingdom contain it, and
  it is abundantly stored away also in the grains from which our bread is
  made, in wheat, rye, and Indian corn. In early life, while the body is
  growing, the supplies of this substance should be carefully provided. The
  evil effects of the deprivation of it are too often and painfully evident
  in the softening of the bones, and in the predisposition to curvature of
  the spine&mdash;deformities which are most deplorable and which continue
  through life.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>12.</b> Iron, its abundance and diffusion? Where found? What part of the blood is it? How supplied to the system? In case of loss of blood or wasting disease?</div>
  <p><b>12. Iron.</b>&mdash;This substance is probably the most abundant
  and widely diffused of the metals. It is found in <!-- Page 57 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>{57}</span>most of the vegetables,
  and is a very important component of animal tissues. It enters into the
  composition of human blood in about one part per thousand. Ordinarily,
  the food conveys to the system enough iron for its use, but it must
  sometimes be introduced separately as a remedy, especially after great
  loss of blood, or after some wasting disease. Under its influence the
  blood seems to be rapidly restored, and a natural color of the lips and
  skin replaces the pallor caused by disease.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>13.</b> Soda, potash, and magnesia? How do they occur?</div>
  <p><b>13. Other Inorganic Substances.</b>&mdash;In addition to the
  substances mentioned, the mineral kingdom supplies compounds of soda,
  potash, and magnesia, which are essential for the use of the body. They
  occur in small quantities in the body, and enter it in combination with
  the various articles of diet.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>14.</b> Organic substances, whence derived? What do they comprise? Groups?</div>
  <p><b>14. Organic Substances.</b>&mdash;These substances are derived from
  the vegetable and animal creations. They comprise all those articles
  which are commonly spoken of as "food," and which are essential to
  sustain the body in life and strength. They are divided into three
  groups, namely: the Albuminoid substances, the Fats, and Sugars.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>15.</b> The Albuminoid class, includes what? These compounds constitute what? The food? Their importance? Their properties?</div>
  <p><b>15. The Albuminoids.</b>&mdash;This class includes three important
  nutritive substances&mdash;(1) <i>Albumen</i>, which gives it its name;
  (2) <i>Fibrin</i>, including <i>gluten</i>; and (3) <i>Casein</i>. These
  compounds constitute a large part of the human body, and the food
  contains them in proportionally large quantities. Their importance is so
  great, and the system so promptly suffers from their absence, that they
  have been styled the "<i>nutritious</i> substances." The properties which
  they hold in common are, that they do not crystallize, and have a
  jelly-like form, except when heat is applied to them, when they harden,
  or <i>coagulate</i>. <!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page58"></a>{58}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>16.</b> Decomposition? Effect of cold? Illustrations? Elephants?</div>
  <p><b>16.</b> They likewise decompose, or <i>putrefy</i>, under the
  influence of warmth and moisture. Hence the decay of all dead animal
  tissues. Cold arrests this process. It is well known that milk, eggs, and
  the like, "keep" much longer in winter than at other seasons. The bodies
  of elephants, caught in the ice many hundred years ago, are occasionally
  borne by the icebergs to the coast of Siberia, completely frozen, but
  preserved almost perfectly in form and limb.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>17.</b> In what substances does albumen exist? What further is said of the egg?</div>
  <p><b>17. Albumen</b> exists in milk, meat, the grains, and the juices of
  many plants; but the purest form is obtained from the white of egg. When
  we consider that an egg is composed chiefly of albumen and
  water&mdash;namely, six parts in seven; and when we also consider the
  numerous, diverse, and complex tissues&mdash;the muscles, bones, internal
  organs, bill, claws, and feathers&mdash;with which the chick is equipped
  on leaving his shell, we are impressed with the importance of these
  apparently simple constituents of the food and body.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>18.</b> Fibrin, gluten, clotting of the blood?</div>
  <p><b>18. Fibrin</b> is derived from meats, and exists in the blood both
  of man and the lower animals. <i>Gluten</i>, or vegetable fibrin,
  resembles closely true fibrin, and is abundantly furnished in wheat and
  other grains from which flour is commonly made. Animal fibrin coagulates
  spontaneously when it is removed from the body, and thus causes the
  "clotting" of the blood.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>19.</b> Casein? Its coagulation? Effect of rennet? Making of cheese?</div>
  <p><b>19. Casein</b> is the curdy ingredient of milk, and a highly
  important food-substance. Its coagulation in milk takes place not from
  heat, but by the addition of an acid, and also when milk becomes sour
  from exposure to the air. It is commonly effected, however, by
  introducing a piece of <i>rennet</i>, a preparation made from a calf's
  stomach. The <i>curds</i>, or casein, may then be separated from the
  <i>whey</i>, <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page59"></a>{59}</span>and made into cheese, by pressing it
  sufficiently to drive off the water.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>20.</b> What are the fats? The oils? How supplied? How alike? Emulsifying? Example? How do we know it?</div>
  <p><b>20. The Fats or Oils.</b>&mdash;This is the second group of organic
  foods. Those which are more solid are called <i>fats</i>: the more fluid
  ones are the <i>oils</i>. Oleaginous substances are supplied in both
  animal and vegetable food; but, from whatever source derived, they are
  chemically much alike. They are insoluble in water, and yet they unite
  readily with the watery fluids of the body, and are by them conveyed to
  its various parts for their nourishment. This is due to their property of
  "emulsifying;" that is, they are held in suspension, in a finely divided
  state, in water. Ordinary milk is an example of an <i>emulsion</i>. We
  know that it contains fat; for butter is obtained from it, and, under the
  microscope, the minute oil-globules may be distinctly seen.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>21.</b> Whence are fatty articles of food derived?</div>
  <p><b>21.</b> In our country and climate, and also in colder climates,
  fatty articles of food are principally derived from the animal creation,
  such as meat or flesh, milk and butter. But most of the bread-stuffs
  contain more or less fat or oil; Indian meal as much as nine parts in a
  hundred.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>22.</b> Appetite of persons in cold climates? What do they require? Upon what must they rely? Why? The Esquimaux? Laplander? Olive and palm?</div>
  <p><b>22.</b> Among persons living in cold climates, the appetite for
  oleaginous food is especially eager; and they require large quantities of
  it to enable them to resist the depressing influences of cold. Since
  vegetation is scanty and innutritious, and the waters of the frozen
  regions abound in animal life, they must rely wholly upon a diet derived
  from the latter source. The Esquimaux consumes daily from ten to fifteen
  pounds of meat or blubber, a large proportion of which is fat. The
  Laplander will drink train-oil, and regards tallow-candles as a great
  delicacy. In hot climates, on the contrary, where flourish the olive <!--
  Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>{60}</span>and the
  palm, this kind of food may be obtained from vegetable sources in
  abundant quantities.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>23.</b> Which are the third of the organic groups? What do they embrace? Points of resemblance?</div>
  <p><b>23. The Sugars, or the Saccharine Substances.</b>&mdash;These
  constitute the third, and last, group of the organic substances, which
  are employed as food. This group embraces, in addition to the different
  kinds of <i>Sugar</i>, the varieties of starch and gum, from whatever
  source derived. The two substances last named do not, at first sight,
  present many points of similarity to sugar; but they closely resemble it
  in respect to their ultimate chemical composition, being made up of the
  same elements, in nearly the same proportions. And their office in the
  system is the same, since they are all changed into sugar by the
  processes of digestion.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>24.</b> Origin of the sugars? Ordinary sugar? Beetroot? Maple-sugar? Grape-sugar? Cane-sugar?</div>
  <p><b>24. Sugar</b> is chiefly of vegetable origin; the animal varieties
  being obtained from honey and milk. The most noticeable characteristic of
  this substance is its agreeable, sweet taste, which makes it everywhere a
  favorite article of food. But this quality of sweetness is not possessed
  by all the varieties of sugar in the same degree; that obtained from
  milk, for instance, has a comparatively feeble taste, but rather imparts
  a gritty feeling to the tongue. The other important properties of sugar
  are, its power to crystallize when evaporated from watery solutions, such
  as the juices of many plants; a tendency to ferment, by which process
  alcohol is produced; and a ready solubility in water. This latter quality
  renders it very easy of digestion, and more so than any other of the
  saccharine group. It is computed that the annual production of sugar, in
  all parts of the world, is more than one million of tons. The kind of
  sugar that is in ordinary use, in this country, is prepared from the
  juice of the sugar-cane, which contains eighteen per cent. of sugar. In
  France it is manufactured from the <!-- Page 61 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>{61}</span>beet root, which holds
  about nine per cent.; the maple-tree of our climate yields a similar
  sugar. The sweet taste of fruits is due to the presence of grape-sugar:
  the white grains seen on raisins belong to this variety. Cane-sugar is
  more soluble than the latter, and has twice the sweetening power.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 15.&mdash;Granules of Potato Starch.</span>
  </div>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>25.</b> Starch, how widely distributed? Its qualities? Its constituents? Its solubility?</div>
  <p><b>25. Starch.</b>&mdash;This is the most widely distributed of the
  vegetable principles. It is tasteless, inodorous, and does not
  crystallize. It consists of minute rounded granules, which, under the
  microscope, reveal a somewhat uniform structure (Fig. 15). Starch will
  not dissolve in cold water, but in boiling water the small grains burst
  open, and may then be dissolved and digested.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>26.</b> How much starch in bread-stuffs? In rice? Unripe fruits? Ripe fruits?</div>
  <p><b>26.</b> The bread stuffs, wheat, corn, and rye flours, are more
  than one-half starch. Rice, which is the "staff of life" to one-third of
  the human family, contains eighty per cent. Unripe fruits have much
  starch in them, which renders them indigestible when eaten uncooked; for
  the grains of raw starch are but slightly acted upon within the body.
  But, under the potent chemistry of the sun's ray, this crude material is
  converted into sugar. Thus are the fruits prepared by the careful hand of
  Nature, so that when ripe they may be freely used without further
  preparation.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>27.</b> Gum, where found? Its composition? Gum Arabic?</div>
  <p><b>27. Gum</b> is commonly found in those articles which <!-- Page 62
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>{62}</span>also contain
  starch; and has the same chemical composition as the latter, but is much
  less nutritious. In the East, gum-arabic and similar substances are
  largely employed as food. Persons who travel by caravan across vast,
  sandy deserts, find such substances well adapted to their wants, since
  they are not perishable, and are easily packed and carried.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>28.</b> The three classes of food principles? What besides? What is said of them? Name the articles not nutritious.</div>
  <p><b>28. Stimulating Substances.</b>&mdash;The three classes of
  food-principles already considered&mdash;the Albuminoids, the Fats, and
  the Sugars&mdash;comprise all the more important organic ingredients of
  our food. There are, besides, a great variety of coloring and flavoring
  matters that stimulate or increase the appetite for food by appealing to
  the eye and taste; but they are not nutritious, and are quickly separated
  from the truly useful substances, and do not long remain in the body.
  Among these may be classed spices, flavors of fruits, tea, coffee, and
  vegetable acids.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>29.</b> What is said of experiments that have been tried?</div>
  <p><b>29. Necessity of a Regulated Diet.</b>&mdash;A great variety of
  experiments have been tried in order to test the relative value of the
  different nutritive principles. They have been practised to some extent
  upon man, but chiefly upon those inferior animals which require a similar
  diet to man.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>30.</b> What has been demonstrated in the first place? Example? Second demonstration? Example? Give the illustration in relation to convertibility.</div>
  <p><b>30.</b> By this means it has been demonstrated that&mdash;first,
  when any one of these substances is eaten exclusively, the body is
  imperfectly nourished, and life is shortened. Dogs fed exclusively upon
  either albumen, fat, or sugar, soon die of starvation. Second, a diet
  long deprived of either of these principles, is a fertile cause of
  disease; for example, on ship-board, where fresh vegetables are not dealt
  out for a long period, <i>scurvy</i> becomes prevalent among the sailors.
  They are, however, to a certain extent mutually convertible, and thus the
  missing article is indirectly supplied. For <!-- Page 63 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>{63}</span>instance, sugar changes
  to fat in the body; and hence, as is well known, the "hands" on a sugar
  plantation grow fat during the sugar season, by partaking freely of the
  ripened juices of the cane.</p>

  <p><b>31.</b> That is the best diet therefore which contains some of each
  of these principles, in due proportion; and that is the worst which
  excludes the most of them. The cravings and experience of man had
  unerringly guided him to a correct regulation of his diet, long before
  the chemistry of food was understood; so that his ordinary meals long ago
  combined these various principles, the necessity and value of which are
  now explained.</p>

<h3>FOOD AND DRINK.</h3>

  <p><i>Necessity for Food&mdash;Waste and Repair&mdash;Hunger and
  Thirst&mdash;Amount of Food&mdash;Renovation of the Body&mdash;Mixed
  Diet&mdash;Milk&mdash;Eggs&mdash;Meat&mdash;Cooking&mdash;Vegetable
  Food&mdash;Bread&mdash;The Potato&mdash;Fruits&mdash;Purity of
  Water&mdash;Action of Water upon Lead&mdash;Coffee, Tea, and
  Chocolate&mdash;Effects of Alcohol.</i></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>1.</b> What follow activity? Examples? Necessity for food?</div>
  <p><b>1. Necessity for Food.</b>&mdash;Activity is everywhere followed by
  waste. The engine uses up coal and water to produce motion, the stream
  wears away its bank, the growing corn-blade draws tribute from the soil.
  When the human body acts, and it is always in action during life, some of
  its particles are worn out and thrown off. This waste must constantly be
  repaired, or the body suffers. In this fact is seen the necessity for
  food. The particles, thus worn out, being henceforth useless, are removed
  from the body. Our <i>food</i> and <i>drink</i> are rapidly transformed
  into a new supply of living, useful material, to be in turn used up and
  replaced by a fresher supply.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>2.</b> Give the theory in relation to waste and repair.</div>
  <p><b>2. Waste and Repair.</b>&mdash;In this way the healthful body,
  though always wasting, is always building up, and does not greatly change
  in size, form, or weight. At two periods of life the processes of waste
  and repair are not exactly balanced. In early life the process of
  building up is more active, and in consequence the form is plump, and the
  stature increases. Repair now exceeds waste. On the other hand, when old
  age comes on, the wasting process is more active, the flesh and weight
  diminish, the skin falls in wrinkles, and the senses become dull. Only
  during the prime of life&mdash;from about twenty to sixty years of
  age&mdash;is the balance exact between loss and gain. <!-- Page 65
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>{65}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>3.</b> System deprived of food? Warning? What is the pain? How proved?</div>
  <p><b>3. Hunger and Thirst.</b>&mdash;When the system is deprived of its
  supply of solid food during a longer time than usual, nature gives
  warning by the sensation of hunger, to repair the losses that have taken
  place. This sensation or pain appears to be located in the stomach, but
  it is really a distress of the system at large. Let a sufficient quantity
  of nourishment be introduced into the system in any other way than by the
  mouth, and it will appease hunger just as certainly as when taken in the
  usual manner.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>4.</b> Feeling of thirst? Seat of the pain? How proved? Time a person can exist without food?</div>
  <p><b>4.</b> The feeling of thirst, in like manner, is evidence that the
  system is suffering from the want of water. The apparent seat of the
  distress of thirst is in the throat; but the injection of water into the
  blood-vessels is found to quench thirst, and by the immersion of the body
  in water, the skin will absorb sufficient to satisfy the demands of the
  system. The length of time that man can exist without food or drink is
  estimated to be about seven days. If water alone be supplied, life will
  last much longer; there being cases recorded where men have lived twenty
  days and over, without taking any solid food.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>5.</b> Amount of food required? The young and others? Those living in hot and cold climates? Habits?</div>
  <p><b>5. Quantity of Food.</b>&mdash;The quantity of food required varies
  greatly, according to the individual and his mode of life. The young, and
  others who lead active lives, or who live in the open air, require more
  food than the old, the inactive, or the sedentary. Those who live in cold
  regions require more than the inhabitants of hot climates. Habit, also,
  has much to do with the quantity of food required. Some habitually eat
  and drink more than they actually need, while a few eat less than they
  should.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>6.</b> Quantity of food daily? How divided? Compare with the weight of the body?</div>
  <p><b>6.</b> The average daily quantity of food and drink for a healthy
  man of active habits is estimated at six pounds. This amount may be
  divided in about the following <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page66"></a>{66}</span>proportions: the mineral kingdom furnishes
  three and one-half pounds, including water and salt; the vegetable
  kingdom, one and one-half pounds, including bread, vegetables, and
  fruits; the animal kingdom, one pound, comprising meat, eggs, butter, and
  the like. This quantity is about one twenty-fourth the weight of the
  body, as it is generally computed; the average weight of an adult man
  being placed at 140 pounds. A man, therefore, consumes an amount of solid
  and liquid nutriment every twenty-four days equal in weight to that of
  his body, a corresponding amount being <i>excreted</i>, or removed from
  the system in the same time.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>7.</b> How often then might the body be renewed? Why is it not? Opinion? How correct? What further is stated?</div>
  <p><b>7. Renovation of the Body.</b>&mdash;By this process, so far as
  weight is concerned, the body might be renewed every twenty-four days;
  but these pounds of food are not all real nutriment. A considerable
  portion of that which we eat is innutritious, and though useful in
  various ways, is not destined to repair the losses of the system. An
  opinion has prevailed that the body is renewed throughout once in seven
  years; how correct this may be it is not easy to decide, but probably the
  renovation of the body takes place in a much shorter period. Some parts
  are very frequently renewed, the nutritive fluids changing more or less
  completely, several times during the day. The muscles, and other parts in
  frequent exercise, change often during a year; the bones not so often,
  and the enamel of the teeth probably never changes after being once fully
  formed.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>8.</b> Habits of nations? Give the different cases.</div>
  <p><b>8. Mixed Diet.</b>&mdash;The habits of different nations in respect
  to diet exhibit the widest and strangest diversity. The civilized, cook
  their food, while savages often eat it in a raw state. Some prefer it
  when fresh, others allow it to remain until it has become tainted with
  decay. Those dwelling in the far north subsist almost wholly on <!-- Page
  67 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>{67}</span>animal food,
  while those living in hot climates have bountiful supplies of delicious
  fruits with which to satisfy all their bodily wants. One race subsists
  upon the banana, another upon the blubber of seals. In temperate
  climates, a diet composed partly of vegetable and partly of animal food
  is preferred.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>9.</b> The point to consider? Vegetable diet? Louis Cornaro? John the Baptist?</div>
  <p><b>9.</b> The important point to consider is, however, not one of
  origin, but whether the chemical principles (mentioned in the last
  chapter) enter into the composition of the diet. A purely vegetable diet
  may be selected which would contain all the principles necessary to
  sustain life. It is recorded of Louis Cornaro, a Venetian noble, that he
  supported himself comfortably for fifty-eight years on a daily allowance
  of twelve ounces of vegetable food, and about a pint of light wine. On
  the other hand, the food of John the Baptist, consisting of "locusts and
  wild honey," is an example of the sustaining power of a diet chiefly
  animal in its origin.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>10.</b> What has been found in our climate? Exclusive vegetable diet?</div>
  <p><b>10.</b> In our climate, those who lead active lives crave an
  allowance of animal food; and it has been found by experience that with
  it they can accomplish more work and are less subject to fatigue, than
  without it. Among nations where an exclusively vegetable diet is
  employed, indigestion is a disorder especially prevalent.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>11.</b> Necessity for change in diet? Continuous use of the same diet? Exception? Why? Too rich diet? Horses?</div>
  <p><b>11.</b> The necessity for occasionally changing or varying the
  diet, is seen in the fact that no single article comprises all the
  necessary principles of food, and that the continuous use of any one
  diet, whether salt or fresh, is followed by defective nutrition and
  disease. There is one exception to this rule: in infancy, milk alone is
  best calculated to support life; for then the digestive powers are
  incompletely developed, and the food must be presented in the simplest
  form possible. It should also be remembered <!-- Page 68 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>{68}</span>that too rich diet is
  injurious, just as truly as one that is inadequate. When the food of
  horses is too nutritious, instinct leads them to gnaw the wood-work of
  their mangers.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>12.</b> Milk as a model food? Cow's milk? The constituents when separated?</div>
  <p><b>12. Different Articles of Diet&mdash;Milk.</b>&mdash;Milk is the
  earliest nutriment of the human race, and in the selection and
  arrangement of its constituents, may be regarded as a model food, no
  other single article being capable of sustaining life so long. Cow's milk
  holds casein, one of the albuminoids, about five parts in one hundred; a
  fatty principle, when separated, known as butter, about four parts; sugar
  of milk four parts; water and salts eighty-seven parts. The casein and
  fatty substance are far more digestible in milk, than after they have
  been separated from it in the form of cheese and butter.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>13.</b> Milk as a beverage? Milk sold in cities? How to detect the cheat?</div>
  <p><b>13.</b> Since milk, in itself, is so rich an article of food, the
  use of it as a beverage is unwise, unless the quantity of the other
  articles consumed be reduced at the same time. The milk sold in cities is
  apt to be diluted with water. The way to detect the cheat is by testing
  the specific gravity of the article. Good milk is about 1030; skimmed
  milk 1035; but milk diluted one-fifth is 1024. An instrument called the
  lactometer is also used, by which the amount of cream present is
  ascertained.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>14.</b> Composition of eggs? Yolk? How should eggs be eaten? Why? How boiled? Why?</div>
  <p><b>14. Eggs.</b>&mdash;The egg is about two-thirds water, the balance
  is pure albumen and fat in nearly equal proportions. The fat is in the
  yolk, and gives it its yellow color. Eggs contain none of the
  sugar-principles, and should be eaten with bread or vegetables that
  contain them. Soft-boiled eggs are more wholesome than those which are
  hard-boiled or fried, as the latter require longer time to digest.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>15.</b> Meats, whence derived? Why important? Flesh of young animals?</div>
  <p><b>15. Meats.</b>&mdash;The meats, so called, are derived from the
  muscular parts of various animals. They are most <!-- Page 69 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>{69}</span>important articles of
  food for adults, inasmuch as they are richly stored with albuminoid
  substances, and contain more or less fat. Such food is very nourishing
  and easily digested if eaten when fresh,&mdash;veal and pork being
  exceptions. The flesh of young animals is more tender and, in general,
  more digestible than that of older ones. All meat is more tough
  immediately after the killing of the animal, but improves by being kept a
  certain length of time.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>16.</b> Preference of persons? Venison? Mutton? Cheese? Uncooked flesh?</div>
  <p><b>16.</b> Some persons prefer flesh that has begun to show signs of
  decomposition, or is unmistakably putrid. By some, venison is not
  considered to have its proper flavor until it is tainted. In England,
  people prefer mutton that is in a similar condition, just as on the
  continent of Europe many delight in cheese that is in a state of
  decomposition. In certain less civilized countries flesh is not only
  eaten uncooked, but in a mouldy, rotten condition. The use of such food
  is not always immediately injurious, but it predisposes to certain
  diseases, as indigestion and fevers.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>17.</b> Cold as a preserver? Meat in Russia? Beef and pork, how preserved? Salted meat as food? Scurvy?</div>
  <p><b>17.</b> Cold is one means of preserving meat from decay. In the
  markets of northern Russia, the frozen carcases of animals stand exposed
  for sale in the winter air for a considerable time, and are sawn in
  pieces, like sticks of wood, as the purchases are made; such meat, when
  thawed, being entirely fit for food. Beef and pork are preserved by
  salting down in brine, and in this condition may be carried on long
  voyages or kept for future use. Salted meat is not as nutritious as
  fresh, since the brine absorbs its rich juices and hardens its fibres.
  Long continued use of salt meats, without fresh vegetables, gives rise to
  the disease called scurvy, formerly very prevalent on shipboard and in
  prisons; but now scarcely known.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>18.</b> The antiquity of the custom of cooking food? Object of cooking? The oyster? Raw meat as an occasional food?</div>
  <p><b>18. Cooking.</b>&mdash;The preparation of food by the agency <!--
  Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>{70}</span>of fire
  is of almost universal practice, even among the rudest nations. The
  object of cooking is to render food more easy of digestion by softening
  it, to develop its flavor, and to raise its temperature more nearly to
  that of the body. A few articles of flesh-food are eaten uncooked in
  civilized lands, the oyster being an instance. Raw meat is occasionally
  eaten by invalids with weak digestive powers, and by men training for
  athletic contests.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>19.</b> Effect of boiling meat? How may the cooking be done? The proper method? Effect? Making of soup?</div>
  <p><b>19.</b> In boiling meat, the water in which it is placed tends to
  dissolve its nutrient juices. In fact, the cooking may be so conducted as
  to rob the meat of its nourishment, its tenderness, and even of its
  flavor. The proper method, in order to preserve or promote these
  qualities, is to place the meat in boiling water, which, after a few
  minutes, should be reduced in temperature. In this way the intense heat,
  at first, coagulates the exterior layers of albumen, and imprisons the
  delicate juices; after that, moderate heat best softens it throughout.
  When soup is to be made, an opposite course should be pursued; for then
  the object is to extract the juices and reject the fibre. Meat, for such
  purpose, should be cut in small pieces and put into cold water, which
  should then be gradually raised to boiling heat.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>20.</b> Roasting? How should it be done? Give the <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'philosphy'.">philosophy</span> of the process. Frying?</div>
  <p><b>20.</b> Roasting is probably the best method of cooking meat,
  especially "joints" or large pieces, as by this process the meat is
  cooked in its own juices. Roasting should begin with intense heat, and be
  continued at a moderate temperature, in order to prevent the drying out
  of the nutritious juices, as by this process an outer coating or crust of
  coagulated albumen is formed. During this process the meat loses
  one-fourth of its weight, but the loss is almost wholly water, evaporated
  by the heat. Too <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>{71}</span>intense or prolonged heat will dry the meat,
  or burn it. Frying is the worst possible method, as the heated fat, by
  penetrating the meat, or other article placed in it, dries and hardens
  it, and thus renders it indigestible.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>21.</b> What is "Trichina?" How guarded against?</div>
  <p><b>21. Trichina.</b>&mdash;It should be remembered that ham, sausages,
  and other forms of pork, should never be eaten in a raw or imperfectly
  cooked condition. The muscle of the pig is often infested by a minute
  animal parasite, or worm, called <i>trichina spiralis</i>. This worm may
  be introduced alive into the human body in pork food, where it multiplies
  with great rapidity, and gives rise to a painful and serious disease.
  This disease has been prevalent in Germany, and cases of it occur from
  time to time in this country.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>22.</b> What part of fish is eaten? What does it resemble? Fish as food for digestion? Fish as a diet?</div>
  <p><b>22. Fish.</b>&mdash;The part of fish that is eaten is the muscle,
  just as in the case of the meats and poultry. It closely resembles flesh
  in its composition, but is more watery. Some varieties are very easy of
  digestion, such as salmon, trout, and cod; others are quite indigestible,
  especially lobsters, clams, and shell-fish generally. A diet in which
  fish enters as the chief article, is ill adapted to strengthen mind or
  body, while its continued use is said to be the fertile source of nearly
  every form of disease of the skin. Some persons are so constituted that
  they can eat no kind of fish without experiencing unpleasant results.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>23.</b> List of vegetable articles? Usefulness of the different vegetables? Strychnia? What further is said in relation to the nourishing and other qualities of vegetables?</div>
  <p><b>23. Vegetable Food.</b>&mdash;The list of vegetable articles of
  diet is a very long one, including the grains from which our bread-stuffs
  are made, the vegetables from the garden, and the fruits. All the
  products of the vegetable kingdom are not alike useful. Some are
  positively hurtful; indeed, the most virulent poisons, as strychnia and
  prussic acid, are obtained from certain vegetables. Again, of such <!--
  Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>{72}</span>articles
  as have been found good for food, some are more nourishing than others:
  some require very little preparation for use, while others are hard and
  indigestible, and can only be used after undergoing many preparatory
  processes. Great care must therefore be exercised, and many experiments
  made, before we can arrive at a complete knowledge in reference to these
  articles of diet. Tea, coffee, and other substances from which drinks are
  made, are of vegetable origin.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>24.</b> Wheat? "Staff of life?" White flour? Hard-grain wheats? Bolting? Graham bread?</div>
  <p><b>24. Bread.</b>&mdash;Wheat is the principal and most valuable kind
  of grain for the service of man. Bread made from wheat-flour has been in
  use for many hundreds of years, and on this account, as well as because
  of its highly nourishing properties, has been aptly called "the staff of
  life." We never become tired of good bread as an article of daily
  food.</p>

  <p>The white kinds of flour contain more starch and less gluten than the
  darker, and are therefore less nutritious. The hard-grain wheat yields
  the best flour. In grinding wheat, the chaff or bran is separated by a
  process called "bolting." Unbolted flour is used for making brown or
  Graham bread.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>25.</b> Leavened bread? Unleavened? Hot bread?</div>
  <p><b>25.</b> The form of bread most easily digested is that which has
  been "leavened," or rendered porous by the use of yeast, or by some
  similar method. Unleavened bread requires much more mastication. Hot
  bread is unwholesome, because it is not firm enough to be thoroughly
  masticated, but is converted into a pasty, heavy mass that is not easily
  digested.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>26.</b> Wheaten bread? Bread and butter? Experiment on the dog?</div>
  <p><b>26.</b> Wheaten bread contains nearly every principle requisite for
  sustaining life, except fat. This is commonly added in other articles of
  diet, especially in butter,&mdash;"bread and butter," consequently,
  forming an almost perfect article of <!-- Page 73 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>{73}</span>food. The following
  experiment is recorded: "A dog eating <i>ad libitum</i> of white bread,
  made of pure wheat, and freely supplied with water, did not live beyond
  fifty days. He died at the end of that time with all the signs of gradual
  exhaustion." Death took place, not because there was anything hurtful in
  the bread, but because of the absence of one or more of the
  food-principles.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>27.</b> State what is said of the Irish potato?</div>
  <p><b>27. The Potato.</b>&mdash;The common or Irish potato is the
  vegetable most extensively used in this country and Great Britain. Among
  the poorer classes in Ireland it is the main article of food. While it is
  not so rich in nutritious substances as many others, it has some very
  useful qualities. It keeps well from season to season, and men do not
  weary of its continuous use. It is more than two-thirds water, the
  balance being chiefly starch, with a little albumen.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>28.</b> Sweet potato? Nightshades? Potatoes when germinating?</div>
  <p><b>28.</b> The sweet potato differs from the white or common, in
  containing more water and a small proportion of sugar. The common potato
  and the tomato belong to the same botanical order as the "nightshades,"
  but do not possess their poisonous qualities, unless we except potatoes
  that are in the process of germination or sprouting, when they are found
  injurious as food.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>29.</b> Fruits? Use of ripe fruit? Nutriment they contain? Starch in unripe fruits? Cooking of unripe fruits?</div>
  <p><b>29. Fruits.</b>&mdash;These are produced, in this country, in great
  abundance, and are remarkable alike for their variety and delicious
  flavor; consequently they are consumed in large quantities, especially
  during the warmer months. The moderate use of ripe fruits, in their
  season, is beneficial, because they offer a pleasant substitute for the
  more concentrated diet that is used in cold weather. The amount of solid
  nutriment they contain is, however, small. The percentage of water in
  cherries is seventy-five, in grapes eighty-one, in apples eighty-two.
  Unripe fruits contain starch, which, during the process of ripening, <!--
  Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>{74}</span>is
  converted into sugar. Such fruits are indigestible and should be avoided:
  cooking, however, in part removes the objections to them.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>30.</b> How should drinking-water be as regards color and smell? Chemically pure water? How obtained? Agreeableness of perfectly pure water?</div>
  <p><b>30. Pure Water.</b>&mdash;It is important that the water we drink
  and use in the preparation of food should be pure. It should be clear and
  colorless, with little or no taste or smell, and free from any great
  amount of foreign ingredients. Chemically pure water does not occur in
  nature: it is only obtained by the condensation of steam, carefully
  conducted, and is not as agreeable for drinking purposes as the water
  furnished by springs and streams. Rain-water is the purest occurring in
  nature; but even this contains certain impurities, especially the portion
  which falls in the early part of a shower; for in its descent from the
  clouds, the particles floating in the air are caught by the falling
  drops.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>31.</b> Spring and well water? Whence the sparkle, or life? The water supply of cities? Croton water? Ridgewood?</div>
  <p><b>31.</b> Water from springs and wells always contains more or less
  foreign matter of mineral origin. This imparts to the drink its pleasant
  taste&mdash;the sparkle, or "life," coming from the gases absorbed by the
  water during its passage under ground. The ordinary supply of cities is
  from some pure stream or pond conveyed from a distance through pipes, the
  limpid fluid containing generally only a small amount of impurity. Croton
  water, the supply of New York City, is very pure, and contains only four
  and a half grains to a gallon: the Ridgewood water of Brooklyn holds even
  less foreign matter.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>32.</b> Impurities in drinking-water? Mineral springs?</div>
  <p><b>32.</b> Drinking-water may contain as large a proportion as sixty
  to seventy grains per gallon of impurity, but a much larger quantity
  renders it unwholesome. The mineral spring waters, used popularly as
  medicines, are highly charged with mineral substances. Some of them, such
  as <!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page75"></a>{75}</span>the waters at Saratoga, contain three
  hundred grains and more to the gallon.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>33.</b> What is stated of the action of water upon lead?</div>
  <p><b>33. Action of Water upon Lead.</b>&mdash;The danger of using water
  that has been in contact with certain metals is well known. Lead is one
  of the most readily soluble, and probably the most poisonous of these
  substances in common use. When pure water and an untarnished surface of
  lead come in contact, the water gradually corrodes the metal, and soon
  holds an appreciable quantity of it in solution. When this takes place
  the water becomes highly injurious: the purer the water, and the more
  recent the use of the metal, the greater will be the danger.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>34.</b> Lead in pipes and other things? Advice? What takes place after the articles of lead have been used much? What is wise?</div>
  <p><b>34.</b> In cities, lead pipes are commonly used to convey water
  through the houses; lead being also used in the construction of roofs,
  cisterns, and vessels for keeping water and other liquids. After the
  articles of lead have been in use several months, the danger of
  lead-poisoning diminishes. An insoluble coating of the sulphate of lead
  forms upon the exposed surface, thus protecting it from further
  corrosion. It is, however, a wise precaution, at all times to reject the
  water or other fluid that has been in contact with leaden vessels over
  night, or for a number of hours. Allow the water in pipes to run freely
  before using.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>35.</b> Coffee as an article of diet? Of what does it consist? How does the water affect the coffee? The peculiar stimulant? How does it affect most persons?</div>
  <p><b>35. Coffee.</b>&mdash;This is an important addition to diet, and if
  moderately used is beneficial to persons of adult age. As commonly
  employed, it consists of an infusion in boiling water of the roasted and
  ground berry. The water extracts certain flavoring and coloring matters,
  but that which gives it its peculiar stimulant qualities is the alkaloid
  <i>caffein</i>. With most persons its action is that of a gentle
  stimulant, without any injurious reaction. It produces a restful feeling
  after exhausting efforts of mind or <!-- Page 76 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>{76}</span>body; it tranquilizes,
  but does not disqualify for labor; and hence it is highly esteemed by
  persons of literary pursuits.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>36.</b> Another property of coffee? Miners of Belgium? The Caravans? Among armies? Taken with meals?</div>
  <p><b>36.</b> Another property of coffee is, that it diminishes the waste
  of the tissues, and consequently permits the performance of excessive
  labor upon an economical and inadequate diet. This has been tested among
  the miners of Belgium. Their allowance of solid food was below that found
  necessary in prisons and elsewhere; but, with the addition of about four
  pints of coffee daily, they were enabled to undergo severe labor without
  reducing their muscular strength. The caravans which traverse the deserts
  are supported by coffee during long journeys and lengthened privation of
  food. Among armies it is indispensable in supplementing their imperfect
  rations, and in relieving the sense of fatigue after great exposure and
  long marches. When taken with meals, coffee is also thought to promote
  digestion.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>37.</b> Effects of tea-drinking? Peculiar principle? The tea beverage, how made? Black and green tea? Excessive use of tea or coffee?</div>
  <p><b>37. Tea.</b>&mdash;The effects of tea-drinking are very similar to
  those of coffee, and are due to a peculiar principle called <i>thein</i>.
  This principle is probably the same as that found in coffee,
  <i>caffein</i>, since the chemical composition of both is precisely
  alike. Tea, as a beverage, is made from the dried leaves of the plant by
  the addition of hot water; if the tea is boiled, the oil which gives it
  its agreeable flavor is driven off with the steam. There are two kinds of
  tea&mdash;the black and the green: the latter is sometimes injurious,
  producing wakefulness and other nervous symptoms. The excessive use of
  either coffee or tea will cause wakefulness.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>38.</b> Experiments made during Kane's expedition?</div>
  <p><b>38.</b> During Dr. Kane's expedition in the Arctic regions, the
  effects of these articles were compared. "After <!-- Page 77 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>{77}</span>repeated trials, the men
  took most kindly to coffee in the morning and tea in the evening. The
  coffee seemed to continue its influence throughout the day, and they
  seemed to grow hungry less rapidly than after drinking tea, while tea
  soothed them after a day's hard labor, and the better enabled them to
  sleep. They both operated upon fatigued men like a charm, and their
  superiority over alcoholic stimulants was very decided."</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>39.</b> State what is said of chocolate.</div>
  <p><b>39.</b> Chocolate is made from the seeds of the cocoa-tree, a
  native of tropical America. Its effects resemble somewhat those of tea
  and coffee, but it is very rich in nutriment. Linnæus, the botanist, was
  so fond of this beverage, that he gave to the cocoa-tree the name,
  <i>Theobroma</i>&mdash;"the Food of the Gods." Its active principle is
  <i>theobromin</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>40.</b> Use of alcoholic drinks, how general? The rule given?</div>
  <p><b>40. Alcohol.</b>&mdash;The list of beverages that are consumed for
  the sake of the alcohol they contain is a very long one. Their use is
  almost universally prevalent, every civilized nation, and nearly every
  barbarous one, having its favorite alcoholic drink; and, as a general
  rule, the nations which stand the highest in civilization have the
  greatest varieties of these beverages,&mdash;at the same time using them
  the most intelligently and wisely.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>41.</b> The beverages produced by fermentation? The ardent spirits? Grains and fruits employed? Long use of wine? Of distilled liquors?</div>
  <p><b>41.</b> The wines and malt liquors that contain a small amount of
  alcohol are produced by fermentation. The beverages that hold a large
  proportion of alcohol, the "ardent spirits," are made by distillation.
  Enormous quantities of grains and fruits are thus yearly diverted from
  their proper uses as food; some of these being corn, wheat, rye, barley,
  potatoes, and rice; also the grape, apple, pear, peach, sugar-cane,
  cherry, fig, and orange. Wine, the fermented juice of the grape, has been
  in use from time immemorial, while the introduction of distilled liquors
  dates from a comparatively recent period. <!-- Page 78 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>{78}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>42.</b> Describe the action of alcohol upon the human system? Experience of Dr. Hayes and others?</div>
  <p><b>42.</b> What is the physiological action of alcohol? Its first and
  most evident action is stimulation: this effect is transient, and is
  followed by a variable degree of depression. At first it sharpens the
  appetite and quickens digestion, but its habitual use impairs both. This
  stimulation is efficient in giving the system an artificial strength
  during some temporary derangement, and in enabling the endurance of
  unusual fatigue or exposure. The experience of Dr. Hayes, and other
  explorers of the polar regions, is that alcohol does not enable the body
  to resist the influence of cold, but, on the contrary, is always
  injurious.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>43.</b> Another property of alcohol? How do we explain the restorative influence of wines and liquors?</div>
  <p><b>43.</b> Another property it has in common with tea and coffee. It
  supports the powers of life, economizes food, and retards the waste of
  tissues; in other words, it "banks the fires," and prevents their burning
  wastefully. On this principle we explain the restorative influence of
  wines or liquors during exhausting diseases, in convalescence, and after
  excessive labors of mind or body.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>44.</b> Alcohol, a poison? Moderate stimulants? Prevailing opinion? Hence?</div>
  <p><b>44.</b> Pure alcohol, or an excessive quantity of ardent spirits,
  is an undoubted poison, and has been frequently known to produce fatal
  results. Stimulants in moderate quantities have been thought to increase
  strength, and in this view they have been called "alcoholic foods." This
  is not now conceded by scientific men. The prevailing opinion is, that
  they serve no useful purpose as an article of diet, and that their
  beneficial influence is limited to cases where the system is enfeebled,
  where some unnatural demand is made upon the vital powers, or where the
  supply of food is insufficient. Hence, while alcohol has not the power to
  build up, it may obstruct the process of pulling down. <!-- Page 79

  Exercise and Sleep.</i></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>1.</b> Design of food? How accomplished?</div>
  <p><b>1. Nutrition.</b>&mdash;The great design of food is to give
  <i>nutriment</i> or nourishment to the body. But this is not accomplished
  directly, as the food must first pass through certain preparatory
  changes, as follows: (1), <i>Digestion</i>, by which the food is reduced
  to a soluble condition; (2), <i>Absorption</i>, by which, when digested,
  it is imbibed into the blood; (3), <i>Circulation</i>, which carries the
  enriched blood to the various parts of the system; and (4),
  <i>Assimilation</i>, by which each tissue derives from the blood the
  materials necessary for its support.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>2.</b> Sustaining power of food? Simile of the engine? Operation in the human body?</div>
  <p><b>2.</b> By these means the sustaining power of food is gradually
  developed and employed, and the vital machinery kept in working order,
  somewhat after the manner of the steam-engine. To operate the latter, the
  force imprisoned within the coal and water is set free and converted into
  motion by the combustion of the fuel and the vaporization of the water.
  It will be seen, however, when we come to study these operations in the
  human body, that they are conducted silently and harmoniously, with
  marvellous delicacy and completeness, and without that friction, and <!--
  Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page81"></a>{81}</span>consequent loss of power, which attend the
  working of the most perfect machinery of man's invention.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>3.</b> Change of food in digestion? Process of digestion? Describe the alimentary canal.</div>
  <p><b>3. General Plan of Digestion.</b>&mdash;The great change which food
  undergoes in digestion is essentially a reforming process, reducing
  articles of diet, which are at first more or less solid, crude, and
  coarse, to a liquid and finely comminuted condition, suitable for
  absorption into the blood. The entire process of digestion takes place in
  what is called the alimentary canal, a narrow, tortuous tube, about
  thirty feet in its entire length. This canal begins in the mouth, extends
  thence downward through the gullet to the stomach (a receptacle in which
  the principal work of digestion is performed), and thence onward through
  the small and large intestines.</p>

  </div>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>4.</b> Situation of the stomach and intestines? Action of the food? Mechanical action? Chemical?</div>
  <p><b>4.</b> The stomach and intestines are situated in the cavity of the
  abdomen (Fig. 16, C, and Fig. 22), and occupy about two-thirds of its
  space. The action to which the food is subjected in these organs is of
  two kinds&mdash;mechanical and chemical. By the former it is crushed,
  agitated, and carried onward from one point to another; by the latter it
  is changed in form through the solvent power of the various digestive
  juices. <!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page82"></a>{82}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>5.</b> Describe the process of mastication? How many and what movements?</div>
  <p><b>5. Mastication.</b>&mdash;As soon as solid food is taken into the
  mouth, it undergoes mastication, or chewing. It is caught between the
  opposite surfaces of the teeth, and by them is cut and crushed into very
  small fragments. In the movements of chewing, the lower jaw plays the
  chief part; the upper jaw, having almost no motion, acts simply as a
  point of resistance, to meet the action of the former. These movements of
  the lower jaw are of three sorts: a vertical or cutting, a lateral or
  grinding, and a <i>to-and-fro</i> or gnawing motion.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>6.</b> Composition of the teeth? Enamel of the teeth? Interior of teeth?</div>
  <p><b>6.</b> The teeth are composed of a bone-like material, and are held
  in place by roots running deeply into the jaw. The exposed portion, or
  "crown," is protected by a thin layer of enamel (Fig. 17, <i>a</i>), the
  hardest substance in the body, and, like flint, is capable of striking
  fire with steel. In the interior of each tooth is a cavity, containing
  blood-vessels and a nerve, which enter it through a minute opening at the
  point of the root (Fig. 19).</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>7.</b> The milk teeth? The permanent teeth?</div>
  <p><b>7.</b> There are two sets of teeth; first, those belonging to the
  earlier years of childhood, called the milk teeth, which are twenty in
  number and small. At six or eight years of age, when the jaw expands, and
  when the growing body requires a more powerful and numerous set, the
  roots of <!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  are "shed," or fall out, one after another (Fig. 18), to make room for
  the permanent set.</p>

  shaped and arranged in the same order: thus, two incisors, one canine,
  two bicuspids, and three molars. The front teeth are small, sharp, and
  chisel-edged, and are well adapted for cutting purposes; hence their name
  incisors. The canines stand next, one on each side of the jaw; these
  receive their name from their resemblance to the long, pointed tusks of
  the dog (Fig. 19). <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  </div>
<div class="sidenotee"><b>10.</b> Different forms of teeth? Human teeth? The inference?</div>
  <p><b>10.</b> It is interesting, at this point, to notice the different
  forms of teeth in different animals, and observe how admirably their
  teeth are suited to the respective kinds of food upon which they subsist.
  In the <i>carnivora</i>, or flesh-feeders, the teeth are sharp and
  pointed, enabling them both to seize their prey, and tear it in pieces;
  while the <i>herbivora</i>, or vegetable-feeders, have broad, blunt
  teeth, with rough crowns, suitable for grinding the tough grasses and
  grains upon which they feed. Human teeth partake of both forms; some of
  them are sharp, and others are blunt; they are therefore well adapted for
  the mastication of both flesh and vegetables. Hence we argue that,
  although man may live exclusively upon either vegetable or animal food,
  he should, when possible, choose a diet made up of both varieties.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>11.</b> Cleaning of teeth? Effects of not cleaning?</div>
  <p><b>11. Preservation of the Teeth.</b>&mdash;In order that the teeth
  shall remain in a sound and serviceable condition, some care is of course
  requisite. In the first place, they require frequent cleansing; for every
  time we take food, some particles of it remain in the mouth; and these,
  on account of the heat and moisture present, soon begin to putrefy. This
  not only renders the breath very offensive, but promotes decay of the
  teeth. <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page86"></a>{86}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>12.</b> Effects upon the saliva? Formation of tartar? How prevented? How destroyed?</div>
  <p><b>12.</b> The saliva, or moisture of the mouth, undergoes a
  putrefactive change, and becomes the fertile soil in which a certain
  minute fungus has its growth. This fluid, too, if allowed to dry in the
  mouth, collects upon the teeth in the form of an unsightly, yellow
  concretion, called tartar. To prevent this formation, and to remove other
  offensive substances, the teeth should be frequently cleaned with water,
  applied by means of a soft tooth-brush. The destruction of the tartar
  fungus is best effected by the use of a weak solution of carbolic
  acid.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>13.</b> Destruction of the enamel? How guarded against?</div>
  <p><b>13.</b> Again, it should be borne in mind that the enamel, Nature's
  protection for the teeth, when once destroyed, is not formed anew; and
  the body of the tooth thus exposed, is liable to rapid decay. On this
  account, certain articles are to be guarded against; such as sharply acid
  substances that corrode the enamel, and hard substances that break or
  scratch it&mdash;as gritty tooth powders, metal tooth picks, and the
  shells of hard nuts. Sudden alternations from heat to cold, when eating
  or drinking, also tend to crack the enamel.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>14.</b> Mixing of food with the saliva? What is the saliva? How secreted? The salivary glands?</div>
  <p><b>14. Insalivation.</b>&mdash;When the morsel of food is cut and
  ground by the teeth, it is at the same time also intimately mixed with
  the saliva, or fluids of the mouth. This constitutes the second step of
  digestion, and is called insalivation. The saliva, the first of the
  digestive solvents, is a colorless, watery, and frothy fluid. It is
  secreted (<i>i. e.</i> separated from the blood) partly by the mucous
  membrane which lines the mouth; but chiefly by the salivary glands, of
  which there are three pairs situated near the mouth.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>15.</b> The flow of saliva? The thought of food? Anxiety and grief? Animals fed upon dry and coarse food?</div>
<p><!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>{87}</span></p>

  <p><b>15.</b> These glands consist of clusters of very small pouches,
  around which a delicate network of blood-vessels is arranged: they empty
  into the mouth by means of little tubes, or ducts. The flow from these
  glands is at all times sufficient to maintain a soft and moist condition
  of the tongue and mouth; but when they are excited by the presence and
  taste of food, they pour forth the saliva more freely. Even the mere
  thought of food will at times cause the saliva to flow, as when the
  appetite is stimulated by the sight or smell of some savory article; so
  that the common expression is correct that "the mouth waters" for the
  favorite articles of food. Anxiety and grief prevent its flow, and cause
  "the tongue to cleave to the roof of the mouth." In the horse and other
  animals, that feed upon dry and coarse fodder, and require an abundant
  supply of saliva, we find large salivary glands, as well as powerful
  muscles of mastication.</p>

<div style="clear: both"></div>
<div class="sidenotee"><b>16.</b> Importance of the process? The first place? The second? The third?</div>
  <p><b>16.</b> The mingling of the saliva with the food seems a simple
  process, but it is one that plays an important part <!-- Page 88 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>{88}</span>in digestion. In the
  first place, it facilitates the motions of mastication, by moistening the
  food and lubricating the various organs of the mouth. Secondly, it
  prepares the way for other digestive acts: by the action of the teeth,
  the saliva is forced into the solid food, softens the harder substances,
  and assists in converting the whole morsel into a semi-solid, pulpy mass,
  that can be easily swallowed, and readily permeated by other digestive
  fluids. The saliva also, by dissolving certain substances, as sugar and
  salt, develops the peculiar taste of each; whereas, if the tongue be dry
  and coated, they are tasteless. Hence, if substances are insoluble, they
  are devoid of taste.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>17.</b> Its final importance? Starch? How effected? Ptyalin?</div>
  <p><b>17.</b> Finally, the saliva has the property of acting chemically
  upon the food. As we have before stated (Chap. IV.), starch, as starch,
  cannot enter the tissues of the body; but, in order to become nutriment,
  must first be changed to grape sugar. This change is, in part, effected
  by the saliva, and takes place almost instantly, whenever it comes in
  contact with cooked starch. This important function is due to an organic
  ingredient of the saliva called <i>ptyalin</i>. This substance has been
  extracted from the saliva by the chemist, and has been found, by
  experiment, to convert into sugar two thousand times its own weight of
  starch.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>18.</b> Each of the processes? Why is a knowledge of the digestive functions important? How shown?</div>
  <p><b>18. Importance of Mastication and Insalivation.</b>&mdash;Each of
  these processes complements the other, and makes the entire work
  available; for, by their joint action, they prepare the food in the best
  possible manner for further digestive changes. The knowledge of these
  preliminary functions will appear the more important, when we reflect
  that they are the only ones which we can regulate by the will. For, as
  soon as the act of swallowing begins, the food not only passes out of
  sight, but beyond <!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page89"></a>{89}</span>control; and the subsequent acts of
  digestion are consequently involuntary and unconsciously performed.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>19.</b> Rapid eating? Describe the process and effects.</div>
  <p><b>19.</b> It is generally known that rapid eating interferes with
  digestion. How does this occur? In the first place, in rapid eating, the
  flow of the saliva is insufficient to moisten the solid parts of the
  food, so that they remain too hard and dry to be easily swallowed. This
  leads to the free and frequent use of water, or some other beverage, at
  meals, to "wash down" the food,&mdash;a most pernicious practice. For
  these fluids, not only cannot take the place of the natural digestive
  juices, but, on the contrary, dilute and weaken them.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>20.</b> Loss of taste? Another effect of rapid eating? Mistakes?</div>
  <p><b>20.</b> Secondly, the saliva being largely the medium of the sense
  of taste, the natural flavors of the food are not developed, and
  consequently it appears comparatively insipid. Hence the desire for
  high-seasoned food, and pungent sauces, that both deprave the taste and
  over excite the digestive organs. Rapid eating also permits the entrance
  of injurious substances which may escape detection by the taste, and be
  unconsciously received into the system. In some instances, the most acrid
  and poisonous substances have frequently been swallowed "by mistake,"
  before the sense of taste could act, and demand their rejection.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>21.</b> Effect of imperfectly broken food in the stomach? Dyspepsia? Overeating?</div>
  <p><b>21.</b> Thirdly, the food, being imperfectly broken up by the
  teeth, is hurried onward to the stomach, to be by it more thoroughly
  divided. But the task thus imposed upon the stomach, it is not at all
  adapted to perform; so that the crude masses of food remain a heavy
  burden within the stomach, and a source of distress to that organ,
  retarding the performance of its legitimate duty. Hence persons who
  habitually eat too rapidly, frequently fall victims to dyspepsia. Rapid
  eating also conduces to overeating. The food is introduced so rapidly,
  that the system has not <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page90"></a>{90}</span>time to recognize that its real wants are
  met, and that its losses have been made good; and hence the appetite
  continues, although more nutriment has been swallowed than the system
  requires, or can healthfully appropriate.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>22.</b> Gullet? Describe the stomach and its location. Effects of gormandizing?</div>
  <p><b>22. The Stomach.</b>&mdash;As soon as each separate portion of food
  is masticated and insalivated, it is swallowed; that is, it is propelled
  downward to the stomach, through a narrow muscular tube about nine inches
  in length, called the <i>&oelig;sophagus</i>, or gullet (Fig. 23). The
  stomach is the only large expansion of the digestive canal, and is the
  most important organ of digestion. It is a hollow, pear-shaped pouch,
  having a capacity of three pints, in the adult. Its walls are thin and
  yielding, and may become unnaturally distended, as in the case of those
  who subsist on a bulky, innutritious diet, and of those who habitually
  gormandize.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>23.</b> Heart-orifice? Gatekeeper? Coins, etc.? Indication of the soft and yielding texture of the stomach?</div>
  <p><b>23.</b> The stomach has also two openings; that by which food
  enters, being situated near the heart, is called the <i>cardiac</i>, or
  heart orifice; the other is the <i>pylorus</i>, or "gatekeeper," which
  guards the entrance to the intestines, <!-- Page 91 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>{91}</span>and, under ordinary
  circumstances, permits only such matters to pass it as have first been
  properly acted upon in the stomach. Coins, buttons, and the like are,
  however, readily allowed to pass, because they can be of no use if
  retained. The soft and yielding texture of this organ&mdash;the
  stomach&mdash;indicates that it is not designed to crush and comminute
  solid articles of food.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>24.</b> What is meant by the gastric juice?</div>
  <p><b>24. The Gastric Juice.</b>&mdash;We have seen how the presence of
  food in the mouth excites the salivary glands, causing the saliva quickly
  to flow. In the same manner, when food reaches the stomach, its inner
  lining, the mucous membrane, is at once excited to activity. (At first
  its surface, which while the stomach is empty presents a pale pink hue,
  turns to a bright red color, for the minute blood-vessels which course
  through it, are filled with blood. Presently a clear, colorless, and acid
  fluid exudes, drop by drop, from its numerous minute glands or "tubules,"
  until finally the surface is moistened in every part, and the fluid
  begins to mingle with the food. This fluid is termed the gastric juice.
  <!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page92"></a>{92}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>25.</b> What is the office of the gastric juice? Acidity of the gastric juice? Quantity of gastric juice used? What becomes of it?</div>
  <p><b>25.</b> The gastric juice is the proper solvent of certain articles
  of food, especially those belonging to the albuminoid class. This solvent
  power is due to its peculiar ingredient, <i>pepsin</i>; in digestion,
  this substance acts like a ferment; that is, it induces changes in the
  food simply by its presence, but does not itself undergo change. The
  acidity of the gastric juice, which is due to <i>lactic acid</i>, is not
  accidental; for we find that the pepsin cannot act in an alkaline
  solution&mdash;that is, one which is not acid or neutral. The quantity of
  gastric juice secreted daily is very large, probably not less than three
  or four pints at each meal. Though this fluid is at once used in the
  reduction of the food, it is not lost; since it is soon re-absorbed by
  the stomach, together with those parts of the food which it has digested
  and holds in solution.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>26.</b> Muscular coat of the stomach? Expansion and contraction of its fibres? Action of the fibres?</div>
  <p><b>26. Movements of the Stomach.</b>&mdash;The inner coating of the
  stomach is the mucous membrane, which, as we have seen, furnishes the
  gastric juice. Next to this coating lies another, called the muscular
  coat, composed of involuntary muscular fibres, some of which run
  circularly, and others in a longitudinal direction. These expand to
  accommodate the food as it is introduced, and contract as it passes out.
  In addition, these fibres are in continual motion while food remains in
  the stomach, and they act in such manner that the contents are gently
  turned round from side to side, or from one end of it to the other.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>27.</b> Peristaltic movements? What is said of our consciousness of and power over these movements? Describe the movements of the pylorus.</div>
  <p><b>27.</b> By these incessant movements of the stomach, called the
  <i>peristaltic</i> movements, the gastric juice comes in contact with all
  parts of the food. We are, however, not conscious that these movements
  take place, nor have we the power to control them. When such portions of
  the food as are sufficiently digested approach the pylorus, it <!-- Page
  93 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"></a>{93}</span>expands to
  allow them to pass out, and it closes again to confine the residue for
  further preparation.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>28.</b> How has the knowledge and the workings of the stomach been ascertained? St. Martin? How else?</div>
  <p><b>28.</b> The knowledge of these and other interesting and
  instructive facts has been obtained by actual observation; the workings
  of the stomach of a living human being have been laid open to view and
  examined&mdash;the result of a remarkable accident. Alexis St. Martin, a
  Canadian <i>voyageur</i>, received a gun-shot wound which laid open his
  stomach, and which, in healing, left a permanent orifice nearly an inch
  in diameter. Through this opening the observer could watch the progress
  of digestion, and experiment with different articles of food. Since that
  occurrence, artificial openings into the stomach of the inferior animals
  have been repeatedly made, so that the facts of stomach-digestion are
  very well ascertained and verified.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>29.</b> What was formerly thought? What do we now know? What else do we now know? Water, salt, and sugar? Absorption?</div>
  <p><b>29. Gastric Digestion.</b>&mdash;What portions of the food are
  digested in the stomach? It was formerly thought that all the great
  changes of digestion were wrought here, but later investigation has
  taught us better. We now know that the first change in digestion takes
  place in the mouth, in the partial conversion of starch into sugar. We
  also know that, of the three organic food principles (considered in
  Chapter IV.) two&mdash;the fats and the sugars&mdash;are but slightly
  affected by the stomach; but that its action is confined to that third
  and very important class, from which the tissues are renewed, the
  albuminoids. A few articles need no preparation before entering the
  system, as water, salt, and grape-sugar. These are rapidly taken up by
  the blood-vessels of the stomach, which everywhere underlie its mucous
  membrane in an intricate and most delicate network. In this way the
  function of absorption begins.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>30.</b> Albuminose? The process? Chyme?</div>
  <p><b>30.</b> The albuminoid substances are speedily attacked and <!--
  Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>{94}</span>digested
  by the gastric juice. From whatever source they are derived, vegetable or
  animal, they are all transformed into the same digestive product, called
  <i>albuminose</i>. This is very soluble in water, and is readily absorbed
  by the blood-vessels of the stomach. After a longer or shorter time,
  varying from one to five hours, according to the individual and the
  quantity and quality of his food, the stomach will be found empty. Not
  only has the digested food passed out, but also those substances which
  the stomach could not digest or absorb have passed little by little
  through the pylorus, to undergo further action in the intestines. At the
  time of its exit, the digested food is of a pulpy consistence, and dark
  color, and is then known as the <i>chyme</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>31.</b> What are the intestines? The small intestines? The large intestines? Their structure?</div>
  <p><b>31. The Intestines.</b>&mdash;The intestines, or "bowels," are
  continuous with the stomach, and consist of a fleshy tube, or canal,
  twenty-five feet in length. The small intestine, whose diameter is about
  one inch and a half, is twenty feet long and very tortuous. The large
  intestine is much wider than the former, and five feet long (Fig. 23).
  The general structure of these organs resembles that of the stomach. Like
  it, they are provided with a mucous membrane, or inner lining, whence
  flow their digestive juices; and, just outside of this, a muscular coat,
  which propels the food onward from one point to another.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>32.</b> Peritoneum? The work of digestion?</div>
  <p><b>32.</b> Moreover, both the intestines and stomach are enveloped in
  the folds of the same outer tunic or membrane, called the
  <i>peritoneum</i>. This is so smooth and so well lubricated, that the
  intestines have the utmost freedom of motion. In the small intestines,
  the work of digestion is completed, the large intestine receiving from
  them the indigestible residue of the food, and in time expelling it from
  the body.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>33.</b> The presence of food in the intestines? Bile?</div>
  <p><b>33. Intestinal Digestion.</b>&mdash;As soon as the food passes the
  pylorus and begins to accumulate in the upper <!-- Page 95 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>{95}</span>part of the intestines,
  it excites the flow of a new digestive fluid, which enters through a
  small tube, or <i>duct</i>, about three inches below the stomach. It is
  formed by the union of two distinct fluids&mdash;the <i>bile</i> and the
  <i>pancreatic</i> juice. The bile is secreted by the liver, which is the
  largest gland of the body, and is situated on the right side and upper
  part of the abdomen (Fig. 22). The bile is constantly formed, but it
  flows most rapidly during digestion. During the intervals of digestion it
  is stored in the <i>gall-bladder</i>, a small membranous bag attached to
  the under side of the liver. This fluid is of a greenish-yellow color,
  having a peculiar smell, and a very bitter taste.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>34.</b> The pancreatic juice? The joint action of these fluids?</div>
  <p><b>34.</b> The pancreatic juice is the product of a gland called the
  <i>pancreas</i>, situated behind the stomach. This fluid is colorless,
  viscid, and without odor. Like the digestive juices previously described,
  it owes its solvent power to its peculiar ferment principle, called
  <i>pancreatin</i>. By the joint action of these fluids, the fatty parts
  of the food are prepared for absorption. By previous steps of digestion
  the fats are merely separated from the other components of the food; but
  here, within the intestines, they are reduced to a state of minute
  division, or <i>emulsion</i>, resembling the condition of butter in milk,
  before it has been churned. There results from this action a white and
  milky fluid, termed the <i>chyle</i>, which holds in solution the
  digestible portions of the food, and is spread over the extensive
  absorbent surface of the small intestines.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>35.</b> The mucous membrane? Experiments on inferior animals?</div>
  <p><b>35.</b> The mucous membrane of the intestines, also, secretes or
  produces, a digestive fluid by means of numerous "follicles," or minute
  glands; this is called the intestinal juice. From experiments on the
  inferior animals, it has been ascertained that this fluid exerts a
  solvent influence over each of the three organic food principles, and in
  this way may supplement and complete the action of the <!-- Page 96
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"></a>{96}</span>fluids
  previously mentioned, viz.:&mdash;of the saliva in converting starch into
  sugar, of the gastric juice in digesting the albuminoids, and of the
  pancreatic juice and bile in emulsifying the fats.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>36, 37.</b> How much thus far has been done with the food? The next process? Give the first way.</div>
  <p><b>36. Absorption.</b>&mdash;With the elaboration of the chyle, the
  work of digestion is completed; but, in a certain sense, the food is yet
  outside of the body; that is, the blood is not yet enriched by it, and it
  is not in a position to nourish the tissues. The process by which the
  liquefied food passes out of the alimentary canal into the blood is
  called absorption. This is accomplished in two ways; first, by the
  <i>blood-vessels</i>. We have seen how the inner membrane of the stomach
  is underlaid by a tracery of minute and numerous vessels, and how some
  portions of the food are by them absorbed. The supply of blood-vessels to
  the intestines is even greater; particularly to the small intestines,
  where the work of absorption is more actively carried on.</p>

  <p><b>37.</b> The absorbing surface of the small intestines, if
  considered as a plane surface, amounts to not less than half a square
  yard. Besides, the mucous membrane is formed in folds with an immense
  number of thread-like prolongations, called <i>villi</i>, which
  indefinitely multiply its absorbing capacity. These minute processes, the
  villi, give the surface the appearance and smoothness of velvet; and
  during digestion, they dip into the canal, and, by means of their
  blood-vessels, absorb its fluid contents, just as the <i>spongioles</i>
  which terminate the rootlets of plants, imbibe moisture from the
  surrounding soil.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>38.</b> How is absorption effected in another way? Describe it. Name of the lacteals? Thoracic duct?</div>
  <p><b>38.</b> Secondly, absorption is also effected by the
  <i>lacteals</i>, a set of vessels peculiar to the small intestines. These
  have their beginnings in the little villi just mentioned, side by side
  with the blood-vessels. These two sets of absorbents run in different
  courses, but their destination is the same, <!-- Page 97 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>{97}</span>which is the right side
  of the heart. The lacteals receive their name from their milky-white
  appearance. After a meal containing a portion of fat, they are then
  distended with chyle, which they are specially adapted to receive: at
  other times they are hardly discernible. The lacteals all unite to form
  one tube, the <i>thoracic duct</i>, which passes upward through the
  <i>thorax</i>, or chest, and empties into a large vein, situated just
  beneath the left collar-bone.</p>

  </div>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>39.</b> The absorbents? Lymph? What further of the lymph?</div>
  <p><b>39. The Absorbents.</b>&mdash;The lacteals belong to a class of
  vessels known as absorbents, or lymphatics, which ramify in nearly all
  parts of the body, except the brain and spinal cord. The fluid which
  circulates through the lymphatics of the limbs, and all the organs not
  concerned in digestion, is called <i>lymph</i>. This fluid is clear and
  colorless, like water, and thus differs from the milky chyle which the
  lacteals carry after digestion: it consists chiefly of the watery part of
  the blood, which was not required by the tissues, and is returned to the
  blood by the absorbents or lymphatics.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>40.</b> What can you state as to the time required for digestion?</div>
  <p><b>40. Circumstances affecting Digestion.</b>&mdash;What length of
  time is required for the digestion of food? From observations made, in
  the case of St. Martin, the Canadian <!-- Page 98 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page98"></a>{98}</span>already referred to, it
  has been ascertained that, at the end of two hours after a meal, the
  stomach is ordinarily empty. How much time is needed to complete the
  digestion of food, within the small intestines, is not certain; but, from
  what we have learned respecting their functions, it must be evident that
  it largely depends upon the amount of starch and fat which the food
  contains.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>41.</b> Circumstances affecting duration of digestion? Fresh food?</div>
  <p><b>41.</b> In addition to the preparations which the food undergoes in
  cooking, which we have already considered, many circumstances affect the
  duration of digestion; such as the quality, quantity, and temperature of
  the food; the condition of the mind and body; sleep, exercise, and habit.
  Fresh food, except new bread and the flesh of animals recently slain, is
  more rapidly digested than that which is stale; and animal food more
  rapidly than that from the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>42.</b> Food in concentrated form? A large quantity of food? Experiment on the dog? Ice-water? Variety of articles?</div>
  <p><b>42.</b> Food should not be taken in too concentrated a form, the
  action of the stomach being favored when it is somewhat bulky; but a
  large quantity in the stomach often retards digestion. If the white of
  one egg be given to a dog, it will be digested in an hour, but if the
  white of eight eggs be given it will not disappear in four hours. A
  wineglassful of ice-water causes the temperature of the stomach to fall
  thirty degrees; and it requires a half-hour before it will recover its
  natural warmth&mdash;about a hundred degrees&mdash;at which the
  operations of digestion are best conducted. A variety of articles, if not
  too large in amount, is more easily disposed of than a meal made of a
  single article; although a single indigestible article may interfere with
  the reduction of articles that are easily digested.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>43.</b> Strong emotion? The tongue of the patient?</div>
  <p><b>43.</b> Strong emotion, whether of excitement or depression, checks
  digestion, as do also a bad temper, anxiety, long fasting, and bodily
  fatigue. The majority of these <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page99"></a>{99}</span>conditions make the mouth dry, that is, they
  restrain the flow of the saliva; and without doubt they render the
  stomach dry also, by preventing the flow of the gastric juice. And, as a
  general rule, we may decide, from a parched and coated tongue, that the
  condition of the stomach is not very dissimilar, and that it is unfit for
  the performance of digestive labor. This is one of the points which the
  physician bears in mind when he examines the tongue of his patient.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>44.</b> Eating between meals? Severe exercise? Sleep after meals?</div>
  <p><b>44.</b> The practice of eating at short intervals, or "between
  meals," as it is called, has its disadvantage, as well as rapid eating
  and over-eating, since it robs the stomach of its needed period of entire
  rest, and thus overtasks its power. With the exception of infants and the
  sick, no persons require food more frequently than once in four hours.
  Severe exercise either directly before or directly after eating retards
  digestion; a period of repose is most favorable to the proper action of
  the stomach. The natural inclination to rest after a hearty meal may be
  indulged, but should not be carried to the extent of sleeping; since in
  that state the stomach, as well as the brain and the muscles, seeks
  release from labor.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>1.</b> What is required by every living organism? In plants? Insects? Reptiles? Man?</div>
  <p><b>1. The Blood.</b>&mdash;Every living organism of the higher sort,
  whether animal or vegetable, requires for the maintenance of life and
  activity, a circulatory fluid, by which nutriment is distributed to all
  its parts. In plants, this fluid is the sap; in insects, it is a watery
  and colorless blood; in reptiles and fishes, it is red but cold blood;
  while in the nobler animals and man, it is the red and warm blood.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>2.</b> Importance and abundance of blood? Dependence of life? Abel? Mosaic law? In what part of the body is blood not found? Quantity of blood in the body?</div>
  <p><b>2.</b> The blood is the most important, as it is the most abundant,
  fluid of the body; and upon its presence, under certain definite
  conditions, life depends. On this account it is frequently, and very
  properly, termed "the vital fluid." The importance of the blood, as
  essential to life, was recognized in the earliest writings. In the
  narration of the death of the murdered Abel, it is written, "the voice of
  his <i>blood</i> crieth from the ground." In the Mosaic law, proclaimed
  over thirty centuries ago, the Israelites were forbidden to eat food that
  contained blood, for the reason that "the life of the flesh is in the
  blood." With the exception of a few tissues, such as the hair, the nails,
  and the <i>cornea</i> of the eye, blood everywhere pervades the body, as
  may be proven by puncturing any part with a <!-- Page 102 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>{102}</span>needle. The total
  quantity of blood in the body is estimated at about one-eighth of its
  weight, or eighteen pounds.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>3.</b> Color of blood? Its consistence? Odor?</div>
  <p><b>3.</b> The color of the blood, in man and the higher animals, as is
  well known, is red; but it varies from a bright scarlet to a dark purple,
  according to the part whence it is taken. "Blood is thicker than water,"
  as the adage truly states, and has a glutinous quality. It has a faint
  odor, resembling that peculiar to the animal from which it is taken.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>4.</b> What is stated of the blood as viewed under the microscope?</div>
  <p><b>4.</b> When examined under the microscope, the blood no longer
  appears a simple fluid, and its color is no longer red. It is then seen
  to be made up of two distinct parts: first, a clear, colorless fluid,
  called the <i>plasma</i>; and secondly, of a multitude of minute solid
  bodies, or corpuscles, that float in the watery plasma. The plasma, or
  nutritive liquid, is composed of water richly charged with materials
  derived from the food, viz., albumen, which gives it smoothness and swift
  motion; fibrin; certain fats; traces of sugar; and various salts.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>5.</b> State what you can of the little bodies called corpuscles.</div>
  <p><b>5. The Blood Corpuscles.</b>&mdash;In man, these remarkable "little
  bodies," as the word <i>corpuscles</i> signifies, are of a yellow color,
  but by their vast numbers impart a red hue to the blood. They are very
  small, having a diameter of about 1/3500 of an inch, and being one-fourth
  of that fraction in thickness; so that if 3,500 of them were placed in
  line, side by side, they would only extend one inch; or, if <!-- Page 103
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>{103}</span>piled one
  above another, it would take at least 14,000 of them to stand an inch
  high. Although so small in size, they are very regular in form. As seen
  under the microscope, they are not globular or spherical, but flat,
  circular, and disc-like, with central depressions on each side, somewhat
  like a pearl button that has not been perforated. In freshly-drawn blood
  they show a disposition to arrange themselves in little rolls like coins
  (Fig. 25).</p>

    <p class="poem">The five small ones at the upper part of the figure,
    represent the human corpuscles magnified 400 times.</p>
  </div>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>6.</b> The size and shape of corpuscles? Why is the fact important?</div>
  <p><b>6.</b> The size and shape of the blood corpuscles vary in different
  animals, so that it is possible to discriminate between those of man and
  the lower animals (Fig. 26). This is a point of considerable practical
  importance. For example, it is sometimes desirable to decide in a court
  of justice the source, whether from man or an inferior animal, of blood
  stains upon the clothing of an accused person, or upon some deadly
  weapon. This may be done by a microscopical examination of a minute
  portion of the dried stain, previously refreshed by means of gum-water.
  Certain celebrated cases are recorded in which the guilt of criminals has
  been established, and they have been condemned and punished upon the
  evidence which science rendered on this single point, the detecting of
  the human from other blood.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>7.</b> The character of the blood of dead animals? Means of detecting such blood?</div>
  <p><b>7.</b> The character of the blood of dead, extinct, and even fossil
  animals, such as the mastodon, has been ascertained by obtaining and
  examining traces of it which had been shut up, perhaps for ages, in the
  circulatory canals of bone. A means of detecting blood in minute
  quantities is found <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page104"></a>{104}</span>in the spectroscope, the same instrument
  by which the constitution of the heavenly bodies has been studied. If a
  solution containing not more than one-thousandth part of a grain of the
  coloring matter of the corpuscle, be examined, this instrument will
  detect it.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>8.</b> White corpuscles? Total number of corpuscles in the body?</div>
  <p><b>8.</b> The corpuscles, just described, are known as the red blood
  corpuscles. Besides these, and floating along in the same plasma, are the
  white corpuscles. These are fewer in number, but larger and globular in
  form. They are colorless, and their motion is less rapid than that of the
  other variety. The total number of both varieties of these little bodies
  in the blood is enormous. It is calculated that in a cubic inch of that
  fluid there are eighty-three millions, and at least five hundred times
  that number in the whole body.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>9.</b> The blood in its natural condition in the body? Describe the process by which the coagulation of blood takes place?</div>
  <p><b>9. Coagulation.</b>&mdash;The blood, in its natural condition in
  the body, remains perfectly fluid; but, within a few minutes after its
  removal from its proper vessels, whether by accident or design, a change
  takes place. It begins to coagulate, or assume a semi-solid consistence.
  If allowed to stand, after several hours it separates into two distinct
  parts, one of them being a dark red jelly, the coagulum, or clot, which
  is heavy and sinks; and the other, a clear, straw-colored liquid, called
  serum, which covers the clot. This change is dependent upon the presence
  in the blood of fibrin, which possesses the property of solidifying under
  certain circumstances; one of these circumstances being when the blood is
  separated from living tissues. The color of the clot is due to the
  entanglement of the corpuscles with the fibrin.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>10.</b> If coagulation were impossible? How is it in fact?</div>
  <p><b>10.</b> In this law of the coagulation of the blood is our
  safeguard against death by hæmorrhage, or against undue loss of blood. If
  coagulation were impossible, the <!-- Page 105 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>{105}</span>slightest injury in
  drawing blood would prove fatal. Whereas now, in vastly the larger
  proportion of cases, bleeding ceases spontaneously, because the blood, as
  it coagulates, stops the mouths of the injured blood-vessels. In another
  class of cases, where larger vessels are cut or torn, it is simply
  necessary to close them by a temporary pressure; for in a few minutes the
  clot will form and seal them up. In still more serious cases, where the
  blood-vessel is of large size, the surgeon is obliged to tie a "ligature"
  about it, and thus prevent the force of the blood-current from washing
  away the clots, which, forming within and around the vessel, would close
  it effectually.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>11.</b> What is worthy of remark? Coagulation of the blood of inferior animals? Of the blood of birds?</div>
  <p><b>11.</b> It is worthy of remark that this peculiarity is early
  implanted in the blood, even before birth, and in advance of any existing
  necessity for it; thus anticipating and guarding against danger. But this
  is not all. Of most of the inferior animals, which, as compared with man,
  are quite helpless, the blood coagulates more rapidly, and in the case of
  the birds, almost instantly. The relative composition of fluid and
  coagulated blood may be thus represented:</p>

<pre>
  <i>Fluid Blood.</i>              <i>Coagulated Blood.</i>

    Plasma----------Serum---------Serum

<div class="sidenotee"><b>12.</b> The blood, as a provider and purifier? What uses does the blood subserve? Experiments? Transfusion?</div>
  <p><b>12. The Uses of the Blood.</b>&mdash;The blood is the great
  provider and purifier of the body. It both carries new materials to all
  the tissues, and removes the worn out particles of matter. This is
  effected by the plasma. It both conveys oxygen and removes carbonic acid.
  This is done through the corpuscles. Some singular experiments have <!--
  Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>{106}</span>been
  tried to illustrate the life-giving power of the blood. An animal that
  has bled so freely as to be at the point of dying, is promptly brought
  back to life by an operation called transfusion, by which fresh blood
  from a living animal is injected into the blood-vessels of his body.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>13.</b> The case of the deaf and feeble dog? Horse? Dead dog?</div>
  <p><b>13.</b> It is related that a dog, deaf and feeble from age, had
  hearing and activity restored to him by the introduction into his veins
  of blood taken from a young dog; and, that a horse, twenty-six years old,
  having received the blood of four lambs acquired new vigor. And further,
  that a dog, just dead from an acute disease, was so far revived by
  transfusion, as to be able to stand and make a few movements.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>14.</b> Transfusion, as a fashionable remedy? What further of transfusion?</div>
  <p><b>14.</b> Transfusion has been practised upon man. At one time,
  shortly after Harvey's discovery of the "Circulation of the Blood," it
  became quite a fashionable remedy, it being thought possible by it to
  cure all forms of disease, and even to make the old young again. But
  these claims were soon found extravagant, and many unhappy accidents
  occurred in its practice; so that being forbidden by government and
  interdicted by the Pope, it rapidly fell into disuse. At the present
  time, however, it is sometimes resorted to in extreme cases, when there
  has been a great and rapid loss of blood; and there are upon record
  several instances where, other means having failed, life has been
  restored or prolonged by the operation of transfusion.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>15.</b> The seat of the reviving power of the blood? What further is related?</div>
  <p><b>15.</b> This reviving power of the blood seems to reside in the
  corpuscles; for transfusion, when attempted to be performed with the
  serum alone, has, in every case, proved fruitless. Now, though so much
  depends upon the blood and its corpuscles, it is a mistake to suppose
  that in them alone is the seat of life, or that they are, in an exclusive
  manner, alive. All the organs and parts of the body are mutually
  dependent one upon the other; and the complete usefulness <!-- Page 107
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>{107}</span>of the blood,
  or of any other part, flows out of the harmonious action of all the
  parts.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>16.</b> Changes in the blood? What further is stated?</div>
  <p><b>16. Change of Color.</b>&mdash;The blood undergoes a variety of
  changes in its journey through the system. As it visits the different
  organs it both gives out and takes up materials. In one place it is
  enriched, in another it is impoverished. By reason of these alterations
  in its composition, the blood also changes its color. In one part of the
  body it is bright red, or arterial; in another it is dark blue, or
  venous. In the former case it is pure and fit for the support of the
  tissues; in the latter, it is impure and charged with effete materials.
  (The details of the change from dark to bright will be given in the
  chapter on Respiration.)</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>17.</b> Motion of the blood? What is meant by the circulation of the blood? How confined? Discovery made by Harvey?</div>
  <p><b>17. Circulation.</b>&mdash;The blood is in constant motion during
  life. From the heart, as a centre, a current is always setting toward the
  different organs; and from these organs a current is constantly returning
  to the heart. In this way a ceaseless circular movement is kept up, which
  is called the Circulation of the Blood. This stream of the vital fluid is
  confined to certain fixed channels, the blood-vessels. Those branching
  from the heart are the arteries; those converging to it are the veins.
  The true course of the blood was unknown before the beginning of the
  seventeenth century. In 1619 it was discovered by the illustrious William
  Harvey. Like many other great discoverers, he suffered persecution and
  loss, but unlike some of them, he was fortunate enough to conquer and
  survive opposition. He lived long enough to see his discovery universally
  accepted, and himself honored as a benefactor of mankind.</p>

  <p><b>18. The Heart.</b>&mdash;The heart is the central engine of the
  circulation. In this wonderful little organ, hardly larger than a man's
  fist, resides that sleepless force by which, during the whole of life,
  the current of the blood is kept in motion. It is placed in the middle
  and front part of the chest, inclining to the left side. The heartbeat
  may be felt and heard between the fifth and sixth ribs, near the
  breast-bone. The shape of the heart is conical, with the apex or point
  downward and in front. The base, which is upward, is attached so as to
  hold it securely in its place, while the apex is freely moveable. In
  order that loss of power from friction may be obviated, the heart is
  enclosed between two layers of serous membrane, which forms a kind of
  sac. This membrane is as smooth as satin, and itself secretes a fluid in
  sufficient quantities to keep it at all times well lubricated. The lining
  membrane of the heart, likewise, is extremely delicate and smooth.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>19.</b> Formation of the heart? Right and left heart?</div>
  <p><b>19. The Cavities of the Heart.</b>&mdash;The heart is hollow, and
  so partitioned as to contain four chambers or cavities; two at the base,
  known as the <i>auricles</i>, from a fancied resemblance to the ear of a
  dog, and two at the apex or point, called <i>ventricles</i>. An auricle
  and a ventricle on the same side, communicate with each other, but there
  is no opening from side to side. It is customary to regard the heart as a
  double organ, and to speak of its division into the right and left heart.
  For while both halves act together in point of time, each half sustains
  an entirely distinct portion of the labor of the circulation. Thus, the
  right heart always carries the dark or venous blood, and the left always
  circulates the bright or arterial blood.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>20.</b> Capacity of the chambers of the heart? What wise provision is mentioned? The auricles?</div>
  <p><b>20.</b> If we examine the heart, we at once notice that though its
  various chambers have about the same capacity, the walls of the
  ventricles are thicker and stronger than those of the auricles. This is a
  wise provision, for it is by the powerful action of the former that the
  blood is forced to the most remote regions of the body. The auricles, on
  the contrary, need much less power, for they simply discharge their
  contents into the cavities of the heart near at hand and below
  them&mdash;into the ventricles. <!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page111"></a>{111}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>21.</b> Substance of the heart? Its fibres? Its movements? The advantage of such movements? Action of the heart? Its period of repose?</div>
  <p><b>21. Action of the Heart.</b>&mdash;The substance of the heart is of
  a deep red color, and its fibres resemble those of the voluntary muscles
  by which we move our bodies. But the heart's movements are entirely
  involuntary. The advantage of this is evident; for if it depended upon us
  to will each movement, our entire attention would be thus engaged, and we
  would find no time for study, pleasure, or even sleep. The action of the
  heart consists in alternate contractions and dilatations. During
  contraction the walls come forcibly together, and thus drive out the
  blood. In dilatation, they expand and receive a renewed supply. These
  movements are called <i>systole</i> and <i>diastole</i>. The latter may
  be called the heart's period of repose; and although it lasts only during
  two-fifths of a heart-beat, or about a third of a second, yet during the
  day it amounts to more than nine hours of total rest.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>22.</b> Remarkable property of the tissue of the heart? How shown? How interesting? In cold-blooded animals? Heart of a turtle? Of a frog? Alligator?</div>
  <p><b>22.</b> A remarkable property of the tissue of the heart is its
  intense vitality. For while it is more constantly active than any other
  organ of the body, it is the last to part with its vital energy. This is
  especially interesting in view of the fact that after life is apparently
  extinguished, as from drowning, or poisoning by chloroform, there yet
  lingers a spark of vitality in the heart, which, by continued effort, may
  be fanned into a flame so as to revivify the whole body. In cold-blooded
  animals this irritability of the heart is especially remarkable. The
  heart of a turtle will pulsate, and the blood circulate for a week after
  its head has been cut off; and the heart will throb regularly many hours
  after being cut out from the creature's chest. The heart of a frog or
  serpent, separated entirely from the body, will contract at the end of
  ten or twelve hours: that of an alligator has been known to beat
  twenty-eight hours after the death of the animal. <!-- Page 112 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>{112}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>23.</b> Course of the blood through the heart? Course of heart-currents?</div>
  <p><b>23. Passage of the Blood through the Heart.</b>&mdash;Let us now
  trace the course of the blood through the several cavities of the heart.
  In the first place, the venous blood, rendered dark and impure by contact
  with the changing tissues of the body, returns to the right heart by the
  veins. It enters and fills the right auricle during its dilatation: the
  auricle then contracts and fills the right ventricle. Almost instantly,
  the ventricle contracts forcibly and hurries the blood along the great
  artery of the lungs, to be purified in those organs. Secondly, having
  completed the circuit of the lungs, the pure and bright arterial blood
  enters the left auricle. This now contracts and fills the left ventricle,
  which cavity, in its turn, contracts and sends the blood forth on its
  journey again through the system. This general direction from right to
  left is the uniform and undeviating course of heart-currents.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>24.</b> Openings of the ventricles? How guarded? How do the valves operate? The consequence? Heart-sounds?</div>
  <p><b>24.</b> The mechanism which enforces and regulates it, is as simple
  as it is beautiful. Each ventricle has two openings, an inlet and an
  outlet, each of which is guarded by strong curtains, or valves. These
  valves open freely to admit the blood entering from the right, but close
  inflexibly against its return. Thus, when the auricle contracts, the
  inlet valve opens; but as soon as the ventricle begins to contract, it
  closes promptly. The contents are then, so to speak, cornered, and have
  but one avenue of escape, that through the outlet valve into the arteries
  beyond. As soon as the ventricle begins to dilate again, this valve shuts
  tightly and obstructs the passage. The closing of these valves occasions
  the two heart-sounds, which we hear at the front of the chest.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>25.</b> Heart-beats? The heart as a susceptible organ? Heat, exercise, etc.? Posture?</div>
  <p><b>25. Frequency of the Heart's Action.</b>&mdash;The alternation of
  contraction and dilation constitutes the <!-- Page 113 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page113"></a>{113}</span>heartbeats. These
  follow each other not only with great regularity, but with great
  rapidity. The average number in an adult man is about seventy-two in a
  minute. But the heart is a susceptible organ, and many circumstances
  affect its rate of action. Heat, exercise, and food will increase its
  action, as cold, fasting, and sleep will decrease it. Posture, too, has a
  curious influence; for if while sitting, the beats of the heart number
  seventy-one; standing erect will increase them to eighty-one, and lying
  down will lower them to sixty-six.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>26.</b> Mental emotions? Sudden excitement? Excessive joy? The heart-beat rate? Bonaparte and Wellington?</div>
  <p><b>26.</b> The modifying influence of mental emotions is very
  powerful. Sudden excitement of feeling will cause the heart to palpitate,
  or throb violently. Depressing emotions sometimes temporarily interrupt
  its movements, and the person faints in consequence. Excessive joy,
  grief, or fear, has occasionally suspended the heart's action entirely,
  and thus caused death. The rate of the heart-beat may be naturally above
  or below seventy-two. Thus it is stated that the pulse of the savage is
  always slower than that of the civilized man. Bonaparte and Wellington
  were very much alike in their heart's pulsations, which were less than
  fifty in the case of each.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>27.</b> Average number of heart-beats? In one hour? Year? Lifetime?</div>
  <p><b>27. Activity of the Heart.</b>&mdash;The average number of
  heart-beats during a lifetime may be considered as at the rate of
  seventy-two per minute, although this estimate is probably low; for
  during several years of early life the rate is above one hundred a
  minute. In one hour, then, the heart pulsates four thousand times; in a
  day, one hundred thousand times; and in a year, nearly thirty-eight
  million times. If we compute the number during a lifetime, thirty-nine
  years being the present average longevity of civilized mankind, we obtain
  as the vast aggregate, fourteen hundred millions of pulsations. <!-- Page
  114 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>{114}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>28.</b> Amount of blood expelled? Theories of the ancients?</div>
  <p><b>28.</b> Again, if we estimate the amount of blood expelled by each
  contraction of the ventricles, at four ounces, then the weight of the
  blood moved during one minute will amount to eighteen pounds. In a day it
  will be about twelve tons; in a year, four thousand tons; and in the
  course of a lifetime, over one hundred and fifty thousand tons. These
  large figures indicate, in some measure, the immense labor necessary to
  carry on the interior and vital operations of our bodies. In this
  connection, we call to mind the fanciful theories of the ancients in
  reference to the uses of the heart. They regarded it as the abode of the
  soul, and the source of the nobler emotions&mdash;bravery, generosity,
  mercy, and love. The words courage and cordiality are derived from a
  Latin word signifying heart. Many other words and phrases, as hearty,
  heart-felt, to learn by heart, and large-hearted, show how tenaciously
  these exploded opinions have fastened themselves upon our language.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>29.</b> The tendency at the present time? Why is this view inadequate?</div>
  <p><b>29.</b> At the present time the tendency is to ascribe purely
  mechanical functions to the heart. This view, like the older one, is
  inadequate; for it expresses only a small part of our knowledge of this
  organ. The heart is unlike a simple machine, because its motive power is
  not applied from without, but resides in its own substance. Moreover, it
  repairs its own waste, it lubricates its own action, and it modifies its
  movements according to the varying needs of the system. It is more than a
  mere force-pump, just as the stomach is something more than a crucible,
  and the eye something more than an optical instrument.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>30.</b> What are the arteries? Their walls? Their membrane?</div>
  <p><b>30. The Arteries.</b>&mdash;The tube-like canals which carry the
  blood away from the heart are the arteries. Their walls are made of
  tough, fibrous materials, so that they sustain the mighty impulse of the
  heart, and are not ruptured. In common with the heart, the arteries have
  a <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page115"></a>{115}</span>delicately smooth lining membrane. They
  are also elastic, and thus re-enforce the action of the heart: they
  always remain open when cut across, and after death are always found
  empty.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>31.</b> Early anatomists? The service of the illustration?</div>
  <p><b>31.</b> The early anatomists observed this phenomenon, and
  supposing that the same condition existed during life, came to the
  conclusion that these tubes were designed to act as air-vessels, hence
  the name artery, from a Greek word which signifies containing air. This
  circumstance affords us an illustration of the confused notions of the
  ancients in reference to the internal operations of the body. Cicero
  speaks of the arteries as "conveying the breath to all parts of the
  body."</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>32.</b> The arterial system? The branches and sub-branches of the arteries?</div>
  <p><b>32.</b> The arterial system springs from the heart by a single
  trunk, like a minute and hollow tree, with numberless branches. As these
  branches leave the heart they divide and subdivide, continually growing
  smaller and smaller, until they can no longer be traced with the naked
  eye. If, then, we continue the examination by the aid of a microscope, we
  see these small branches sending off still smaller ones, until all the
  organs of the body are penetrated by arteries.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>33.</b> Successive undulations from the heart? Course of the arteries? Protection of the arteries? General location of the arteries?</div>
  <p><b>33. The Pulse.</b>&mdash;With each contraction of the left heart,
  the impulse causes a wave-like motion to traverse the entire arterial
  system. If the arteries were exposed to view, we might see successive
  undulations speeding from the heart to the smallest of the branches, in
  about one-sixth part of a second. The general course of the arteries is
  as far as possible from the surface. This arrangement is certainly wise,
  as it renders them less liable to injury, the wounding of an artery being
  especially dangerous. It also protects the arteries from external and
  unequal pressure, by which the force of the heart would be <!-- Page 116
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>{116}</span>counteracted
  and wasted. Accordingly, we generally find these vessels hugging close to
  the bones, or hiding behind the muscles and within the cavities of the
  body.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>34.</b> Where do the arteries lie? If we apply the finger? Pulse? Where felt?</div>
  <p><b>34.</b> In a few situations, however, the arteries lie near the
  surface; and if we apply the finger to any of these parts, we will
  distinctly feel the movement described, taking place in harmony with the
  heart-beat. This is part of the wave-motion just mentioned, and is known
  as the pulse. All are more familiar with the pulse at the wrist, in the
  <i>radial</i> artery; but the pulse is not peculiar to that position, for
  it may be felt in the <i>carotid</i> of the neck, in the <i>temporal</i>
  at the temple, and elsewhere, especially near the joints.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 30.&mdash;The Form of the Pulse.</span>
  </div>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>35.</b> The pulse as an index? Of what does it inform the physician? Instrument for recording pulsation?</div>
  <p><b>35.</b> Since the heart-beat makes the pulse, whatever affects the
  former affects the latter also. Accordingly, the pulse is a good index of
  the state of the health, so far as the health depends upon the action of
  the heart. It informs the physician of the condition of the circulation
  in four particulars: its rate, regularity, force, and fullness; and
  nearly every disease modifies in some respect the condition of the pulse.
  A very ingenious instrument, known as the sphygmograph, or pulse-writer,
  has recently been invented, by the aid of which the pulse is made to
  write upon paper its own signature, or rather to sketch its own profile.
  This instrument shows with great accuracy the difference between the
  pulses of health and those of disease. In Fig. 30 is traced the form of
  the pulse in health, which should be read from left to right. That part
  of the trace <!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page117"></a>{117}</span>which is nearly perpendicular coincides
  with the contraction of the ventricles; while the wavy portion marks
  their dilatation.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>36.</b> What are the veins? How do they form? What do they resemble?</div>
  <p><b>36. The Veins.</b>&mdash;The vessels which convey the blood on its
  return to the heart are the veins. They begin in the several organs of
  the body, and at first are extremely small; but uniting together as they
  advance, they constantly increase in size, reminding us of the way in
  which the fine rootlets of the plant join together to form the large
  roots, or of the rills and rivulets that flow together to form the large
  streams and rivers. In structure, the veins resemble the arteries, but
  their walls are comparatively inelastic. They are more numerous, and
  communicate with each other freely in their course, by means of
  interlacing branches.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 31.&mdash;The Valves of the Veins.</span>
  </div>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>37.</b> Valves in the veins? What are they? Their position? Experiment with the cord?</div>
  <p><b>37.</b> But the chief point of distinction is in the presence of
  the valves in the veins. These are little folds of membrane, disposed in
  such a way, that they only open to receive blood flowing toward the
  heart, and close against a current in the opposite direction. Their
  position in the veins on the back of the hand may be readily observed, if
  we first obstruct the return of blood by a cord tied around the forearm
  or wrist. In a few minutes the veins will appear swollen, and upon them
  will be seen certain prominences, about an inch apart. These latter
  indicate the location of the valves, or, rather, they show that the
  vessels in front of the valves are distended by the blood, which cannot
  force a passage back through them.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>38.</b> What will be proved by the experiment? What inference is drawn?</div>
  <p><b>38.</b> This simple experiment proves that the true direction of
  the venous blood is toward the heart. That the color <!-- Page 118
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>{118}</span>of the blood
  is dark, will be evident, if we compare the hand thus bound by a cord
  with the hand not so bound. It also proves that the veins lie
  superficially, while the arteries are beneath the muscles, well protected
  from pressure; and that free communication exists from one vein to
  another. If now we test the temperature of the constricted member by
  means of a thermometer, we will find that it is colder than natural,
  although the amount of blood is larger than usual. From this fact we
  infer, that whatever impedes the venous circulation tends to diminish
  vitality; and hence, articles of clothing or constrained postures, that
  confine the body or limbs, and hinder the circulation of the blood, are
  to be avoided as injurious to the health.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>39.</b> Capillaries? How regarded? Harvey?</div>
  <p><b>39. The Capillaries.</b>&mdash;A third set of vessels completes the
  list of the organs of the circulation, namely, the <i>capillary</i>
  vessels, so called (from the Latin word <i>capillaris</i>, hair-like),
  because of their extreme fineness. They are, however, smaller than any
  hair, having a diameter of about 1/3000 of an inch, and can only be
  observed by the use of the microscope. These vessels may be regarded as
  the connecting link between the last of the arteries and the first of the
  veins. The existence of these vessels was unknown to Harvey, and was the
  one step wanting to complete his great work. The capillaries were not
  discovered until 1661, a short time after the invention of the
  microscope.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>40.</b> The circulation of the blood in the web of a frog's foot? Describe it. How general is the existence of the tissues?</div>
  <p><b>40.</b> The circulation of the blood, as seen under the microscope,
  in the transparent web of a frog's foot, is a spectacle of rare beauty,
  possessing more than ordinary interest, when we consider that something
  very similar is taking place in our own bodies, on a most magnificent
  scale. It is like opening a secret page in the history of our own frames.
  We there see distinctly the three classes of vessels with their moving
  contents; first, the artery, <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page119"></a>{119}</span>with its torrent of blood rushing down
  from the heart, secondly, the vein, with its slow, steady stream flowing
  in the opposite direction; and between them lies the network of
  capillaries, so fine that the corpuscles can only pass through "in single
  file." The current has here an uncertain or swaying motion, hurrying
  first in one direction, then hesitating, and then turning back in the
  opposite direction, and sometimes the capillaries contract so as to be
  entirely empty. Certain of the tissues are destitute of capillaries; such
  are cartilage, hair, and a few others on the exterior of the body. In all
  other structures, networks of these vessels are spread out in countless
  numbers: so abundant is the supply, that it is almost impossible to
  puncture any part with the point of a needle without lacerating tens, or
  even hundreds of these vessels.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>41.</b> Elasticity of the capillaries? Grain of sand in the eye? Blush? Other cases?</div>
  <p><b>41.</b> The capillaries are elastic, and may so expand as to
  produce an effect visible to the naked eye. If a grain of sand, or some
  other foreign particle, lodge in the eye, it will become irritated, and
  in a short time the white of the eye will be "blood-shot." This
  appearance is due to an <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page120"></a>{120}</span>increase in the size of these vessels. A
  blush is another example of this, but the excitement comes through the
  nervous system, and the cause is some transient emotion, either of
  pleasure or pain. Another example is sometimes seen in purplish faces of
  men addicted to drinking brandy; in them the condition is a congestion of
  the capillary circulation, and is permanent, the vessels having lost
  their power of elastic contraction.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>42.</b> Show what time is required for a given portion of blood to travel once around the body.</div>
  <p><b>42. Rapidity of the Circulation.</b>&mdash;That the blood moves
  with great rapidity is evident from the almost instant effects of certain
  poisons, as prussic acid, which act through the blood. Experiments upon
  the horse, dog, and other inferior animals, have been made to measure its
  velocity. If a substance, which is capable of a distinct chemical
  reaction (as <i>potassium ferrocyanide</i>, or <i>barium nitrate</i>), be
  introduced into a vein of a horse on one side, and blood be taken from a
  distant vein on the other side, its presence may be detected at the end
  of twenty or thirty-two seconds. In man, the blood moves with greater
  speed, and the circuit is completed in twenty-four seconds.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>43.</b> Time required for all the blood to circulate completely around?</div>
  <p><b>43.</b> What length of time is required for all the blood of the
  body to make a complete round of the circulation? This question cannot be
  answered with absolute accuracy, since the amount of the blood is subject
  to continual variations. But, if we assume this to be one-eighth of the
  weight of the body, about eighteen pounds, it will be sufficiently
  correct for our purpose. Now to complete the circuit, this blood must
  pass once through the left ventricle, the capacity of which is two
  ounces. Accordingly, we find that, under ordinary circumstances, all the
  blood makes one complete rotation every two minutes; passing successively
  through the heart, the capillaries of the lungs, the arteries, the
  capillaries of the extremities, and through the veins. <!-- Page 121

<div class="sidenotee"><b>44.</b> What is meant by assimilation? What can you say of its use, etc.? Time?</div>
  <p><b>44. Assimilation.</b>&mdash;The crowning act of the circulation,
  the furnishing of supplies to the different parts of the body, is
  effected by means of the capillaries. The organs have been wasted by use;
  the blood has been enriched by the products of digestion. Here, within
  the meshes of the capillary network, the needy tissues and the needed
  nutriment are brought together. By some mysterious chemistry, each tissue
  selects and withdraws from the blood the materials it requires, and
  converts them into a substance like itself. This conversion of lifeless
  food into living tissue is called assimilation. The process probably
  takes place at all times, but the period especially favorable for it is
  during sleep. Then the circulation is slower, and more regular, and most
  of the functions are at rest. The body is then like some trusty ship,
  which after a long voyage is "hauled up for repairs."</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>45.</b> What is stated of the injuries to the blood-vessels?</div>
  <p><b>45. Injuries to the Blood-vessels.</b>&mdash;It is important to be
  able to discriminate between an artery and a vein, in the case of a
  wound, and if we remember the physiology of the circulation we may
  readily do so. For, as we have already seen, hæmorrhage from an artery is
  much more dangerous than that from a vein. The latter tends to cease
  spontaneously after a short time. The arterial blood flows away from the
  heart with considerable force, in jets; its color being bright scarlet.
  The venous blood flows toward the heart from that side of the wound
  furthest from the heart; its stream being continuous and sluggish; its
  color dark. In an injury to an artery, pressure should be made between
  the heart and the wound; and in the case of a vein that persistently
  bleeds, it should be made upon the vessel beyond its point of injury.

</blockquote>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>1.</b> Difference between the two sets of capillaries? Change effected by respiration or breathing?</div>
  <p><b>1. The Object of Respiration.</b>&mdash;In one set of capillaries,
  or hair-like vessels, the blood is impoverished for the support of the
  different members and organs of the body. In another capillary system the
  blood is refreshed and again made fit to sustain life. The former belongs
  to the greater or <i>systemic</i> circulation; the latter to the lesser
  or <i>pulmonary</i>, so called from <i>pulmo</i>, the lungs, in which
  organs it is situated. The blood, as sent from the right side of the
  heart to the lungs, is venous, dark, impure, and of a nature unfit to
  circulate again through the tissues. But, when the blood returns from the
  lungs to the left side of the heart, it has become arterial, bright,
  pure, and no longer hurtful to the tissues. This marvellous purifying
  change is effected by means of the very familiar act of respiration, or
  breathing.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>2.</b> What are the lungs? How many lungs are there? Lung-substance? Its properties? The pleura?</div>
  <p><b>2. The Lungs.</b>&mdash;The lungs are the special organs of
  respiration. There are two of them, one on each side of the chest, which
  cavity they, with the heart, almost wholly occupy. The lung-substance is
  soft, elastic, and sponge-like. Under pressure of the finger, it
  <i>crepitates</i>, or crackles, and floats when thrown into water; these
  properties being <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page124"></a>{124}</span>due to the presence of air in the minute
  air-cells of the lungs. To facilitate the movements necessary to these
  organs, each of them is provided with a double covering of an exceedingly
  smooth and delicate membrane, called the <i>pleura</i>. One layer of the
  pleura is attached to the walls of the chest, and the other to the lungs;
  and they glide, one upon the other, with utmost freedom. Like the
  membrane which envelops the heart, the pleura secretes its own
  lubricating fluid, in quantities sufficient to keep it always moist.</p>

  </div>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>3.</b> Communication of the lungs with the external air? Bronchial tubes?</div>
  <p><b>3. The Air-Passages.</b> &mdash;The lungs communicate with the
  external air by means of certain air-tubes, the longest of which, the
  <i>trachea</i>, or windpipe, runs along the front of the neck (Fig. 34,
  E, and 35). Within the chest this tube divides into two branches, one
  entering each lung; these in turn give rise to numerous branches, or
  bronchial tubes, as they are called, which gradually diminish in size
  until they are about one-twenty-fifth of an inch in diameter. Each of
  these terminates in a cluster of little pouches, or "air-cells," having
  very thin walls, and covered with a capillary network, the most intricate
  in the body (Fig. 36).</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>4.</b> Office of the bronchial tubes? What further can you state of them?</div>
  <p><b>4.</b> These tubes are somewhat flexible, sufficiently so to bend
  when the parts move in which they are situated; but they are greatly
  strengthened by bands or rings of cartilage which keep the passages
  always open; otherwise there would be a constantly-recurring tendency to
  collapse after every breath. The lung-substance essentially consists of
  these bronchial tubes and terminal air-cells, with the blood-vessels
  ramifying about them (Fig. 37). At the top of the trachea is the larynx,
  a sort of <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page126"></a>{126}</span>box of cartilage, across which are
  stretched the vocal cords. Here the voice is produced chiefly by the
  passage of the respired air over these cords, causing them to
  vibrate.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>5.</b> The epiglottis? When it does not close in time, what is the consequence?</div>
  <p><b>5.</b> Over the opening of the larynx is found the
  <i>epiglottis</i>, which fits like the lid of a box at the entrance to
  the lungs, and closes during the act of swallowing, so that food and
  drink shall pass backward to the &oelig;sophagus, or gullet (Fig. 38).
  Occasionally it does not close in time, and some substance intrudes
  within the larynx, when we at once discover, by a choking sensation, that
  "something has gone the wrong way," and, by coughing, we attempt to expel
  the unwelcome intruder. The epiglottis is one of the many safeguards
  furnished by nature for our security and <!-- Page 127 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>{127}</span>comfort, and is planned
  and put in place long before these organs are brought into actual use in
  breathing and in taking food.</p>

<p><!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>{128}</span></p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:23%;">
      <a href="images/fig_039.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig_039.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 39.--Ciliated Cells." title="Fig. 39.--Ciliated Cells." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 39.&mdash;Ciliated Cells.</span>
  </div>

  <p><b>6.</b> The air-passages are lined through nearly their whole extent
  with mucous membrane, which maintains these parts in a constantly moist
  condition. This membrane has a peculiar kind of cells upon its outer
  surface. If examined under a powerful microscope, we may see, even for a
  considerable time after their removal from the body, that these cells
  have minute hair-like processes in motion, which wave like a field of
  grain under the influence of a breeze (Fig. 39). This is a truly
  beautiful sight; and since it is found that these little <i>cilia</i>, as
  they are called, always produce currents in one direction, from within
  outward, it is probable that they serve a useful purpose in catching and
  carrying away from the lungs dust and other small particles drawn in with
  the breath (Fig. 39). The three diseases which more commonly affect the
  lungs, as the result of exposure, are pneumonia, or inflammation of the
  lungs, implicating principally the air-cells; bronchitis, an inflammation
  of the large bronchial tubes; and pleurisy, an inflammation of the
  investing membrane of the lungs, or pleura. Among the young, an affection
  of the trachea takes place, known as croup.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>7.</b> The act of breathing? Extension of the chest by breathing?</div>
  <p><b>7. The Movements of Respiration.</b>&mdash;The act of breathing has
  two parts&mdash;(1), <i>inspiration</i>, or drawing air into the lungs,
  and (2), <i>expiration</i>, or expelling it from the lungs again. In
  inspiration, the chest extends in its length, breadth, and height, or
  width. We can prove that this is the case as regards the two latter, by
  observing the effect of a deep breath. The ribs are elevated by means of
  numerous muscles, some of which occupy the entire spaces between those
  bones. But the increase in length, or vertically, is not so apparent, as
  it is caused by a muscle within the body called the <i>diaphragm</i>, it
  being the thin partition which separates the chest from the abdomen,
  rising like a dome within the chest. (Fig. 16). <!-- Page 129 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page129"></a>{129}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>8.</b> Contraction of the diaphragm? Power of the diaphragm? Effects of extending the walls of the chest? The habit of taking frequent and deep inspirations?</div>
  <p><b>8.</b> With every inspiration, the diaphragm contracts, and in so
  doing, approaches more nearly a plane, or horizontal, surface, and thus
  enlarges the capacity of the chest. Laughing, sobbing, hiccoughing, and
  sneezing are caused by the spasmodic or sudden contraction of the
  diaphragm. The special power of this muscle is important in securing
  endurance, or "long wind," as it is commonly expressed; which may be
  obtained mainly by practice. It is possessed in a marked degree by the
  mountaineer, the oarsman, and the trained singer. As the walls of the
  chest extend, the lungs expand, and the air rushes in to fill them. This
  constitutes an inspiration. The habit of taking frequent and deep
  inspirations, in the erect position, with the shoulders thrown back,
  tends greatly to increase the capacity and power of the organs of
  respiration.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>9.</b> Expiration? The mechanism of expiration?</div>
  <p><b>9. Expiration</b> is a less powerful act than inspiration. The
  diaphragm relaxes its contraction, and ascends in the form of a dome; the
  ribs descend and contract the chest; while the lungs themselves, being
  elastic, assist to drive out the air. The latter passes out through the
  same channels by which it entered. At the end of each expiration there is
  a pause, or period of repose, lasting about as long as the period of
  action.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>10.</b> Frequency of respiration? Effect of hurried action of the heart?</div>
  <p><b>10. Frequency of Respiration.</b>&mdash;It is usually estimated
  that we breathe once during every four beats of the heart, or about
  eighteen times in a minute. There is, of course, a close relation between
  the heart and lungs, and whatever modifies the pulse, in like manner
  affects the breathing. When the action of the heart is hurried, a larger
  amount of blood is sent to the lungs, and, as the consequence, they must
  act more rapidly. Occasionally, the heart beats so very forcibly that the
  lungs cannot keep pace with it, and then we experience a peculiar sense
  of <!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page130"></a>{130}</span>distress from the want of air. This takes
  place when we run until we are "out of breath." At the end of every fifth
  or sixth breath, the inspiration is generally longer than usual, the
  effect being to change more completely the air of the lungs.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>11.</b> Respiration controlled by the will? Advantage of the knowledge to us?</div>
  <p><b>11.</b> Although, as a general rule, the work of respiration goes
  on unconsciously and without exertion on our part, it is nevertheless
  under the control of the will. We can increase or diminish the frequency
  of its acts at pleasure, and we can "hold the breath," or arrest it
  altogether for a short time. From twenty to thirty seconds is ordinarily
  the longest period in which the breath can be held; but if we first expel
  all the impure air from the lungs, by taking several very deep
  inspirations, the time may be extended to one and a half or even two
  minutes. This should be remembered, and acted upon, before passing
  through a burning building, or any place where the air is very foul. The
  arrest of the respiration may be still further prolonged by training and
  habit; thus it is said, the pearl-fishers of India can remain three or
  four minutes under water without being compelled to breathe.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>12.</b> Capacity of the lungs? Time required to renovate the air in the lungs? In tranquil respiration? Importance of the provision?</div>
  <p><b>12. Capacity of the Lungs.</b>&mdash;The lungs are not filled and
  emptied by each respiration. For while their full capacity, in the adult,
  is three hundred and twenty cubic inches, or more than a gallon, the
  ordinary breathing air is only one-sixteenth part of that volume, or
  twenty cubic inches, being two-thirds of a pint. Accordingly, a complete
  renovation, or rotation, of the air of the lungs does not take place more
  frequently than about once in a minute; and by the gradual introduction
  of the external air, its temperature is considerably elevated before it
  reaches the delicate pulmonary capillaries. In tranquil respiration, less
  than two-thirds of the breathing power is <!-- Page 131 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page131"></a>{131}</span>called into exercise,
  leaving a reserve capacity of about one hundred and twenty cubic inches,
  equivalent to three and one half pints. This provision is indispensable
  to the continuation of life; otherwise, a slight embarrassment of
  respiration, by an ordinary cold, for instance, would suffice to cut off
  the necessary air, and the spark of life would be speedily
  extinguished.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>13.</b> The atmosphere? How high or deep? How essential to life? Marine life in perfectly pure water and air?</div>
  <p><b>13. The Air we breathe.</b>&mdash;The earth is enveloped on all
  sides by an invisible fluid, called the atmosphere. It forms a vast and
  shoreless ocean of air, forty-five miles deep, encircling and pervading
  all objects on the earth's surface, which is absolutely essential for the
  preservation of all vegetable and animal life,&mdash;in the sea, as well
  as on the land and in the air. At the bottom, or in the lower strata of
  this aerial ocean, we move and have our being. Perfectly pure water will
  not support marine life, for a fish may be drowned in water from which
  the air has been exhausted, just as certainly as a mouse, or any other
  land animal, will perish if put deeply into the water for a length of
  time. The cause is the same in both cases: the animal is deprived of the
  requisite amount of air. It is also stated, that if the water-supply of
  the plant be deprived of air, its vital processes are at once
  checked.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>14.</b> Composition of the air? Properties of the two gases?</div>
  <p><b>14.</b> The air is not a simple element, as the ancients supposed,
  but is formed by the mingling of two gases, known to the chemist as
  oxygen and nitrogen, in the proportion of one part of the former to four
  parts of the latter. These gases are very unlike, being almost opposite
  in their properties: nitrogen is weak, inert, and cannot support life;
  while oxygen is powerful, and incessantly active; and is the essential
  element which gives to the atmosphere its power to support life and
  combustion. The discovery of this fact was made by the French chemist,
  Lavoisier, in 1778. <!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page132"></a>{132}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>15.</b> Air once breathed? An animal in it? A candle? Analysis of expired air? Change in volume?</div>
  <p><b>15. Changes in the Air from Respiration.</b>&mdash;Air that has
  been once breathed is no longer fit for respiration. An animal confined
  within it will sooner or later die; so too, a lighted candle placed in it
  will be at once extinguished. If we collect a quantity of expired air and
  analyze it, we shall find that its composition is not the same as that of
  the inspired air. When the air entered the lungs it was rich in oxygen;
  now it contains twenty-five per cent. less of that gas. Its volume,
  however, remains nearly the same; its loss being replaced by another and
  very different gas, which the lungs exhaled, called <i>carbonic acid</i>,
  or, as the chemist terms it, <i>carbon dioxide</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>16.</b> What else has the expired air gained? When and where noticed?</div>
  <p><b>16.</b> The expired air has also gained moisture. This is noticed
  when we breathe upon a mirror, or the window-pane, the surface being
  tarnished by the condensation of the watery vapor exhaled by the lungs.
  In cold weather, this causes the fine cloud which is seen issuing from
  the nostrils or mouth with each expiration, and contributes in forming
  the feathery crystals of ice which decorate our window-panes on a
  winter's morning.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>17.</b> Nature of the watery vapor? Its effects upon animals?</div>
  <p><b>17.</b> This watery vapor contains a variable quantity of animal
  matter, the exact nature of which is unknown; but when collected it
  speedily putrefies and becomes highly offensive. From the effects, upon
  small animals, of confinement in their own exhalations, having at the
  same time an abundant supply of fresh air, it is believed that the
  organic matters thrown off by the lungs and skin are direct and active
  poisons; and that to such emanations from the body, more than to any
  other cause, are due the depressing and even fatal results which follow
  the crowding of large numbers of persons into places of limited capacity.
  <!-- Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<div class="sidenotee"><b>18.</b> Give some of the instances furnished by history.</div>
  <p><b>18.</b> History furnishes many painful instances of the ill effects
  of overcrowding. In 1756, of one hundred and forty-six Englishmen
  imprisoned in the Black Hole of Calcutta, only twenty-three, at the end
  of eight hours, survived. After the battle of Austerlitz, three hundred
  prisoners were crowded into a cavern, where, in a few hours, two-thirds
  of their number died. On board a steam-ship, during a stormy night, one
  hundred and fifty passengers were confined in a small cabin, but when
  morning came, only eighty remained alive.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>19.</b> Change in the blood from blue to red. Upon what does the change depend? How shown?</div>
  <p><b>19. Changes in the Blood from Respiration.</b>&mdash;The most
  striking change which the blood undergoes by its passage through the
  lungs, is the change of color from a dark blue to bright red. That this
  change is dependent upon respiration has been fully proved by experiment.
  If the trachea, or windpipe, of a living animal be so compressed as to
  exclude the air from the lungs, the blood in the arteries will gradually
  grow darker, until its color is the same as that of the venous blood.
  When the pressure is removed the blood speedily resumes its bright hue.
  Again, if the animal be made to breathe an atmosphere containing more
  oxygen than atmospheric air, the color changes from scarlet to vermilion,
  and becomes even brighter than arterial blood. This change of color is
  not of itself a very important matter, but it indicates a most important
  change of composition.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>20.</b> What does the air lose and gain by respiration? What, the blood? Air as food?</div>
  <p><b>20.</b> The air, as we have seen, by respiration loses oxygen and
  gains carbonic acid: the blood, on the contrary, gains oxygen and loses
  carbonic acid. The oxygen is the food of the blood corpuscles; while the
  articles we eat and drink belong more particularly to the plasma of the
  blood. The air, then, it is plain, is a sort of food, and we should <!--
  Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page134"></a>{134}</span>undoubtedly so regard it, if it were not
  for the fact that we require it constantly, instead of taking it at
  stated intervals, as is the case with our articles of diet. Again, as the
  demand of the system for food is expressed by the sensation of hunger, so
  the demand for air is marked by a painful sensation called
  suffocation.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>21.</b> Moist animal membranes? How shown with the bladder?</div>
  <p><b>21. Interchange of Gases in the Lungs.</b>&mdash;As the air and the
  blood are not in contact, they being separated from each other by the
  walls of the air-cells and of the blood-vessels, how can the two gases,
  oxygen and carbonic acid, exchange places? Moist animal membranes have a
  property which enables them to transmit gases through their substance,
  although they are impervious to liquids. This may be beautifully shown by
  suspending a bladder containing dark blood in a jar of oxygen. At the end
  of a few hours the oxygen will have disappeared, the blood will be
  brighter in color, and carbonic acid will be found in the jar.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>22.</b> Gaseous diffusion? If oxygen be not received? If carbonic acid be retained?</div>
  <p><b>22.</b> If this interchange takes place outside of the body, how
  much more perfectly must it take place within, where it is favored by
  many additional circumstances! The walls of the vessels and the air-cells
  offer no obstacle to this process, which is known as gaseous diffusion.
  Both parts of the process are alike of vital importance. If oxygen be not
  received, the organs cease to act; and if carbonic acid be retained in
  the blood, its action is that of a poison; unconsciousness, convulsions,
  and death following.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>23.</b> Difference in the appearance and composition of the blood? Temperature of the blood? The blood while passing through the lungs? The consequence?</div>
  <p><b>23. Difference between Arterial and Venous Blood.</b>&mdash;The
  following table presents the essential points of difference in the
  appearance and composition of the blood, before and after its passage
  through the lungs:&mdash; <!-- Page 135 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>The temperature of the blood varies considerably; but the arterial
  stream is generally warmer than the venous. The blood imparts heat to the
  air while passing through the lungs, and consequently the contents of the
  right side of the heart has a higher temperature than the contents on the
  left side.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>24.</b> What do we learn by means of the spectroscope? "Carriers of oxygen?" Blue blood in the system?</div>
  <p><b>24.</b> By means of the spectroscope, we learn that the change of
  color in the blood has its seat in the corpuscles; and that, according as
  they retain oxygen, or release it, they present the spectrum of arterial
  or venous blood. There evidently exists, on the part of these little
  bodies, an affinity for this gas, and hence they have been called
  "carriers of oxygen." It was long ago thought that blue blood was a trait
  peculiar to persons of princely and royal descent, and boastful allusions
  to the "<i>sang azure</i>" of kings and nobles are quite often met with.
  Physiology, however, informs us that blue blood flows in the veins of the
  low as well as the high, and that so far from its presence indicating a
  mark of purity, it, in reality, represents the waste and decay of the
  system.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>25.</b> The amount of air that passes in and out of the lungs?</div>
  <p><b>25. Amount of Respiratory Labor.</b>&mdash;During ordinary calm
  respiration, we breathe eighteen times in a minute; and twenty cubic
  inches of air pass in and out of the lungs with every breath. This is
  equivalent to the use of three hundred and sixty cubic inches, or more
  than ten pints of air each minute. From this we calculate that the
  quantity of air which hourly traverses the lungs is about thirteen cubic
  feet, or seventy-eight gallons; and daily, not <!-- Page 136 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>{136}</span>less than three hundred
  cubic feet, an amount nearly equal to the contents of sixty barrels.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>26.</b> Air absorbed in its transit through the lungs? The loss? Carbonic acid exhaled? Effect of excitement or exertion? What estimate?</div>
  <p><b>26.</b> Of this large volume of air five per cent. is absorbed in
  its transit through the lungs. The loss thus sustained is almost wholly
  of oxygen, and amounts to fifteen cubic feet daily. The quantity of
  carbonic acid exhaled by the lungs during the day is somewhat less, being
  twelve cubic feet. Under the influence of excitement or exertion, the
  breathing becomes more frequent and more profound; and then the internal
  respiratory work increases proportionately, and may even be double that
  of the above estimate. It has been estimated that in drawing a full
  breath, a man exerts a muscular force equal to raising two hundred pounds
  placed upon the chest.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>27.</b> Importance of the oxygen in the atmosphere? Injurious character of gases?</div>
  <p><b>27. Impurities of the Air.</b>&mdash;The oxygen in the atmosphere
  is of such prime importance, and its proportion is so nicely adjusted to
  the wants of man, that any gas or volatile substance which supplants it
  must be regarded as a hurtful impurity. All gases, however, are not alike
  injurious. Some, if inhaled, are necessarily fatal; <i>arsenuretted
  hydrogen</i> being one of these, a single bubble of which destroyed the
  life of its discoverer, Gehlen. Others are not directly dangerous, but by
  taking the place of oxygen, and excluding it from the lungs, they become
  so. Into this latter class we place carbonic acid.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>28.</b> Pungency of gases? The inference? Our safeguard?</div>
  <p><b>28.</b> Most of the actively poisonous gases have a pungent or
  offensive odor; and, as may be inferred, most repugnant odors indicate
  the presence of substances unfit for respiration. Accordingly, as we
  cannot see or taste these impurities, the sense of smell is our principal
  safeguard against them; and we recognize the design which has planted
  this sense, like a sentinel at the proper entrance of the <!-- Page 137
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>{137}</span>air-passages,
  the nostrils, to give us warning of approaching harm. Take, as an
  example, the ordinary illuminating gas of cities, from which so many
  accidents happen. How many more deaths would it cause if, when a leak
  occurs, we were not able to discover the escape of the gas by means of
  its disagreeable odor.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>29.</b> The air of rooms in which fever-sick persons are confined?</div>
  <p><b>29.</b> Organic matters exist in increased measure in the expired
  breath of sick persons, and impart to it, at times, a putrid odor. This
  is especially true in diseases which, like typhus and scarlet fever, are
  referable to a blood poison. In such cases the breath is one of the means
  by which nature seeks to expel the offending material from the system.
  Hence, those who visit or administer to fever-sick persons should obey
  the oft-repeated direction, "not to take the breath of the sick." At such
  times, if ever, fresh air is demanded, not alone for the sick, but as
  well for those who are in attendance.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>30.</b> Animalcula in the water? Dust in the air?</div>
  <p><b>30. Dust in the Air.</b>&mdash;Attention has lately been directed
  to the dust, or haze, that marks the ray of sunshine across a shaded
  room. Just as, many years ago, it was discovered that myriads of
  animalcula infested much of the water we drank, so now the microscope
  reveals "the gay motes that dance along a sunbeam" to be, in part,
  composed of multitudes of animal and vegetable forms of a very low grade,
  the germs of fermentation and putrefaction, and the probable sources of
  disease.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>31.</b> The best air filter? The remarks of Prof. Tyndall?</div>
  <p><b>31.</b> It is found that the best filter by which to separate this
  floating dust from the air is cotton wool, although a handkerchief will
  imperfectly answer the same purpose. In a lecture on this subject by
  Prof. Tyndall, he remarks that, "by breathing through a cotton wool
  respirator, the noxious air of the sick room is restored to practical
  purity. Thus filtered, attendants may breathe the air unharmed. <!-- Page
  138 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>{138}</span>In all
  probability, the protection of the lungs will be the protection of the
  whole system. For it is exceedingly probable that the germs which lodge
  in the air-passages are those which sow epidemic disease in the body. If
  this be so, then disease can certainly be warded off by filters of cotton
  wool. By this means, so far as the germs are concerned, the air of the
  highest Alps may be brought into the chamber of the invalid."</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>32.</b> Carbonic acid in volcanic regions? In Java? At Lake Avernus? In mines?</div>
  <p><b>32. Carbonic Acid in the Air.</b>&mdash;We have already spoken of
  this gas as an exhalation from the lungs, and a source of impurity; but
  it exists naturally in the atmosphere in the proportion of one half part
  per thousand. In volcanic regions it is poured forth in enormous
  quantities from fissures in the earth's surface. Being heavier than air,
  it sometimes settles into caves and depressions in the surface. It is
  stated that in the island of Java, there is a place called the "Valley of
  Poison," where the ground is covered with the bones of birds, tigers, and
  other wild animals, which were suffocated by carbonic acid while passing.
  The Lake Avernus, the fabled entrance to the infernal regions, was, as
  its name implies, bird-less, because the birds, while flying over it,
  were poisoned by the gas and fell dead into its waters. In mines,
  carbonic acid forms the dreaded <i>choke-damp</i>, while carburetted
  hydrogen is the <i>fire-damp</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>33.</b> In the open air? Amount of carbonic acid exhaled by a man? A gas-burner? A room fire? From furnaces?</div>
  <p><b>33.</b> In the open air, men seldom suffer from carbonic acid, for,
  as we shall see presently, nature provides for its rapid distribution,
  and even turns it to profitable use. But its ill effects are painfully
  evident in the abodes of men, in which it is liable to collect as the
  waste product of respiration and of that combustion which is necessary
  for lighting and warming our homes. A man exhales, during repose, not
  less than one-half cubic foot of carbonic acid per hour. One gas-burner
  liberates five cubic feet in the <!-- Page 139 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>{139}</span>same time, and spoils
  about as much air as ten men. A fire burning in a grate or stove emits
  some gaseous impurity, and at the same time abstracts from the air as
  much oxygen as twelve men would consume in the same period, thus
  increasing the relative amount of carbonic acid in the air. From
  furnaces, as ordinarily constructed, this gas, with other products of
  combustion, is constantly leaking and vitiating the air of tightly-closed
  apartments.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>34.</b> Effects of inhaling carbonic acid alone? In small quantities?</div>
  <p><b>34. Effects of Impure Air.</b>&mdash;Carbonic acid, in its pure
  form, is irrespirable, causing rapid death by suffocation. Air containing
  forty parts per thousand of this gas (the composition of the expired
  breath) extinguishes a lighted candle, and is fatal to birds; when
  containing one hundred parts, it no longer yields oxygen to man and other
  warm-blooded animals; and is of course at once fatal to them. In smaller
  quantities, this gas causes headache, labored respiration, palpitation,
  unconsciousness, and convulsions.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>35.</b> Effects of the air in crowded and badly ventilated rooms?</div>
  <p><b>35.</b> In crowded and badly ventilated apartments, where the
  atmosphere relatively contains from six to ten times the natural amount
  of carbonic acid, the contaminated air causes dulness, drowsiness, and
  faintness; the dark, impure blood circulating through the brain,
  oppressing that organ and causing it to act like a blunted tool. This is
  a condition not uncommon in our schools, churches, court-rooms, and the
  like, the places of all others where it is desirable that the mind should
  be alert and free to act; but, unhappily, an unseen physiological cause
  is at work, dispensing weariness and stupor over juries, audience, and
  pupils.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>36.</b> A cause of consumption? How was the fact illustrated?</div>
  <p><b>36.</b> Another unmistakable result of living in and breathing foul
  air is found in certain diseases of the lungs, especially consumption.
  For many years the barracks of <!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page140"></a>{140}</span>the British army were constructed without
  any regard to ventilation; and during those years the statistics showed
  that consumption was the cause of a very large proportion of deaths. At
  last the government began to improve the condition of the buildings,
  giving larger space and air-supply; and as a consequence, the mortality
  from consumption has diminished more than one-third.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>37.</b> How, in the case of the lower animals? Tendency of certain occupations?</div>
  <p><b>37.</b> The lower animals confined in the impure atmosphere of
  menageries, contract the same diseases as man. Those brought from a
  tropical climate, and requiring artificial warmth, generally die of
  consumption. In the Zoological gardens of Paris, this disease affected
  nearly all monkeys, until care was taken to introduce fresh air by
  ventilation; and then it almost wholly disappeared. The tendency of
  certain occupations to shorten life is well known; disease being
  occasioned by the fumes and dust which arise from the material employed,
  in addition to the unhealthful condition of the workshop or factory where
  many hours are passed daily.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>38.</b> Give the fact as set forth in the table.</div>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>39.</b> What can you state of the diffusive power of gases? The added influence of the winds?</div>
  <p><b>39. Nature's Provision for Purifying the Air.</b>&mdash;We have
  seen that carbonic acid is heavier than air, and is poisonous. Why, then,
  does it not sink upon and overwhelm mankind with a silent, invisible wave
  of death? Among the gases there is a more potent force than gravity,
  which forever precludes such a tragedy. It is known as the diffusive
  power of gases. It acts according to a definite law, and with a
  resistless energy compelling these gases, when in contact, to mingle
  until they are thoroughly diffused. The added influence of the winds is
  useful, by insuring more rapid changes in the air; air in motion being
  perfectly wholesome. The rains also wash the air.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>40.</b> How is the constant purity of the air secured? Explain the process?</div>
  <p><b>40.</b> We have seen that the whole animal creation is constantly
  abstracting oxygen from the atmosphere, and as constantly adding to it
  vast volumes of a gas injurious alike to all, even in small quantities.
  How, then, does the air retain, unchanged, its life-giving properties?
  The constant purity of the air is secured by means of the vegetable
  creation. Carbonic acid is the food of the plants, and oxygen is its
  waste product. The leaves are its lungs, and under the stimulus of
  sunlight a vegetable respiration is set in motion, the effects of which
  are just the reverse of the function we have been considering. Thus
  nature purifies the air, and at the same time builds up beautiful and
  useful forms of life from elements of decay.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>41.</b> What process occurs in the sea? How is the fact illustrated?</div>
  <p><b>41.</b> In the sea, as in the air, the same circle of changes is
  observed. Marine animals consume oxygen and give off carbonic acid; while
  marine plants consume carbonic acid and liberate oxygen. Taking advantage
  of this fact, we may so arrange aquaria with fishes and sea-plants, in
  their proper combinations, so that each supplies the needs of the other,
  and the water requires seldom to be renewed. This <!-- Page 142 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page142"></a>{142}</span>affords us, on a small
  scale, an illustration of the mutual dependence of the two great kingdoms
  of nature; as well as of those compensating changes which are taking
  place on such a grand scale in the world about us.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>42.</b> Character of the external air? Of the air in our dwellings? What becomes imperative? Imperfect ventilation of our dwellings?</div>
  <p><b>42. Ventilation.</b>&mdash;Since the external atmosphere, as
  provided by nature, is always pure, and since the air in our dwellings
  and other buildings is almost always impure, it becomes imperative that
  there should be a free communication from the one to the other. This we
  aim to accomplish by ventilation. As our houses are ordinarily
  constructed, the theory of ventilation, "to make the internal as pure as
  the external air," is seldom carried out. Doors, windows, and flues, the
  natural means of replenishing the air, are too often closed, almost
  hermetically, against the precious element. Special means, or special
  attention, must therefore be used to secure even a fair supply of fresh
  air. This is still more true of those places of public resort, where many
  persons are crowded together.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>43.</b> What hints are given for the ventilation of our dwellings?</div>
  <p><b>43.</b> If there are two openings in a room, one as a vent for foul
  air, and the other an inlet for atmospheric air, and if the openings be
  large, in proportion to the number of air consumers, the principal object
  will be attained. Thus, a door and window, each opening into the outer
  air, will ordinarily ventilate a small apartment; or a window alone will
  answer, if it be open both above and below, and the open space at each
  end be not less than one inch for each occupant of the room, when the
  window is about a yard wide. The direction of the current is generally
  from below upward, since the foul, heated air tends to rise; but this is
  not essential. Its rate need not be rapid; a "draught," or perceptible
  current, is never necessary to good ventilation. The temperature of the
  air admitted may be warm or cold. It is thought by many that if the <!--
  Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>{143}</span>air
  is cold, it is pure; but this is an error, since cold air will receive
  and retain the same impurities as warm air.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>44.</b> State what Florence Nightingale says about inhaling night air?</div>
  <p><b>44.</b> Shall we open our bedrooms to the night air? Florence
  Nightingale says, in effect, that night air is the only air that we can
  then breathe. "The choice is between pure air without and impure air
  within. Most people prefer the latter,&mdash;an unaccountable choice. An
  open window, most nights in the year, can hurt no one. In great cities,
  night air is the best and purest to be had in twenty-four hours. I could
  better understand, in towns, shutting the windows during the day than
  during the night."</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>45.</b> Warmth of the bird as compared with that of the air? Of the fish and the water? Heat in animals and plants? How illustrated with the thermometer?</div>
  <p><b>45. Animal Heat.</b>&mdash;Intimately connected with respiration is
  the production of animal heat, or the power of maintaining the
  temperature of the body above that of the medium in which the creature
  moves; thus, the bird is warmer than the air, and the fish than the
  water. This elevation of temperature is a result of the various chemical
  changes which are constantly taking place in the system. Although common
  to all animals, in a greater or less degree, heat is not peculiar to
  them; since plants also generate it, especially at the time of sprouting
  and flowering. If a thermometer be placed in a cluster of geranium
  flowers, it will indicate a temperature several degrees above that of the
  surrounding air.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>46.</b> Amount of heat in animals, how apportioned? As regards the birds? Frogs, and other sluggish animals? Arrangement made by <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'zooligsts'.">zoologists</span>?</div>
  <p><b>46.</b> Among animals great differences are noticed in this
  respect, but the degree of heat produced is always proportional to the
  activity of respiration and the amount of oxygen consumed. Accordingly,
  the birds, whose habits are extremely active, and whose breathing
  capacity is the greatest, have uniformly the highest temperature.
  Sluggish animals, on the contrary, as frogs, lizards, and snakes, have
  little need for oxygen, and have incompletely <!-- Page 144 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page144"></a>{144}</span>developed lungs; these
  animals are cold to the touch, that is, they have relatively a lower
  temperature than man, and their positive temperature is but little above
  that of the external air. Accordingly, zoologists have so arranged the
  animal kingdom that <i>warm-blooded</i> animals, including man, the
  birds, and the quadrupeds, are classified together; while the
  <i>cold-blooded</i> animals, such as the fish, tortoise, frog, and all
  that have no vertebral column, are classed by themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>47.</b> State what is said respecting the temperature of the human body.</div>
  <p><b>47.</b> The temperature of the human body is about 100° Fahrenheit,
  and remains about the same through winter and summer, in the tropics as
  well as in the frozen regions of the north. It may change temporarily
  within the range of about twelve degrees; but any considerable, or
  long-continued elevation or diminution of the bodily heat is certain to
  result disastrously.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>48.</b> Ability of man to adapt himself to different climates? In what does the power to resist cold consist? What is said about warm clothing?</div>
  <p><b>48.</b> Man is able to adapt himself to all extremes of climate;
  and, in fact, by means of clothing, shelter, and food, is able to create
  for himself an artificial climate where-ever he choses to reside. The
  power to resist cold consists chiefly in preventing the heat which is
  generated by the vital processes of the body from being lost by
  radiation. Warm clothing, such as we wear in winter, has, in reality, the
  same temperature as that which is worn in summer; but, by reason of being
  thick and porous, it is a bad conductor of heat, and thus prevents the
  escape of that produced by the body. If woollen fabrics were
  intrinsically warm, no one would wrap a piece of flannel, or blanket,
  around a block of ice to prevent its melting in summer.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>49.</b> Men in an atmosphere above the boiling-point? In foundries and glass works?</div>
  <p><b>49.</b> The faculty of generating heat explains how it is that we
  are enabled to resist the effects of cold; but how does the body
  withstand a temperature higher than its <!-- Page 145 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page145"></a>{145}</span>own? Men have been
  known to remain several minutes in an atmosphere heated above the
  boiling-point of water, and yet the temperature of their own bodies was
  not greatly elevated. Those who labor in foundries and glass-works are
  habitually subjected to very high degrees of temperature, but they do not
  suffer in health more than those engaged in many other occupations.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>50.</b> The regulation of the temperature of the body. Give the explanation.</div>
  <p><b>50.</b> The regulation of the temperature of the body is effected
  by means of perspiration, and by its evaporation. So long as the skin
  acts freely and the air freely absorbs the moisture, the heat of the body
  does not increase, for whenever evaporation takes place, it is attended
  by the abstraction of heat&mdash;that is, the part becomes relatively
  colder. This may be tested by moistening some part of the surface with
  cologne, ether, or other volatile liquid, and then causing it to
  evaporate rapidly by fanning. The principle that evaporation produces
  cold has been ingeniously and practically employed, in the manufacture of
  ice, by means of freezing machines.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>51, 52.</b> State what is said of spontaneous combustion.</div>
  <p><b>51. Spontaneous Combustion.</b>&mdash;Is it possible that the
  temperature of the living body can be so increased, that its tissues will
  burn spontaneously? From time to time, cases have been reported in which,
  by some mysterious means, considerable portions of the human body have
  been consumed, apparently by fire, the victim being found dead, or
  incapable of explaining the occurrence. Hence, the theory has been
  current that, under certain conditions, the tissues of the body might
  become self-ignited; and the fact that this so-called <i>spontaneous
  combustion</i> has ordinarily taken place in those who had been addicted
  to the use of alcoholic drinks, has given a color of probability to the
  opinion. It has been supposed that the flesh of these unfortunate persons
  becoming saturated with the inflammable properties of the alcohol thus
  taken into the <!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page146"></a>{146}</span>system, took fire upon being exposed to a
  flame, as of a lighted candle, or, indeed, without any external cause.
  But, whether this be possible or not, one thing is certain, this strange
  kind of combustion has never been actually witnessed by any one competent
  to give a satisfactory account of it.</p>

  <p><b>52.</b> The results that have been observed may be satisfactorily
  explained by the accidental ignition of the clothes, or other articles
  near the body, and by the supposition that the individual was at the time
  too much stupefied by intoxication, to notice the source of danger, and
  provide for his safety. The highest temperature that has been observed in
  the body, about 112° Fahrenheit, is too low to ignite the vapor of
  alcohol; much less will it cause the burning of animal tissues. It is
  undoubtedly true that when the tissues are filled with alcohol,
  combustion will more easily take place than when the body is in a normal
  state; but, under any condition, the combustion of the body requires a
  higher degree of heat than can be generated by the body itself, or the
  mere <i>proximity</i> of a lighted candle, or any cause of a similar
  character. <!-- Page 147 --><span class="pagenum"><a

</blockquote>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>1.</b> What processes are known as the vegetative functions? Why so called? What properties and functions does the plant possess? Their object?</div>
  <p><b>1. Animal Functions.</b>&mdash;The vital processes which we have
  been considering, in the three previous chapters, of digestion,
  circulation, and respiration&mdash;belong to the class of functions known
  as <i>vegetative</i> functions. That is, they are common to vegetables as
  well as animals; for the plant, like the animal, can originate nothing,
  not even the smallest particle of matter; and yet it grows, blossoms, and
  bears fruit, by reason of obtaining and digesting the nutriment which the
  air and soil provide. The plant has its circulatory fluid and channels,
  by which the nutriment is distributed to all its parts. It has, also, a
  curious apparatus in its foliage, by which it abstracts from the air
  those gaseous elements so necessary to its support; and thus it
  accomplishes vegetable respiration. These vegetative functions have their
  beginning and end within the organism of the plant; and their object is
  the preservation of the plant itself, as well as of the entire
  species.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>2.</b> What second set of powers has the animal? What functions are mentioned? The advantage they give?</div>
  <p><b>2.</b> The animal, in addition to these vegetative functions, has
  another set of powers, by the use of which he becomes conscious of a
  world external to himself, and brings <!-- Page 149 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page149"></a>{149}</span>himself into active
  relations with it. By means of the vegetative processes, his life and
  species are maintained; while, by means of certain animal functions, he
  feels, acts, and thinks. These functions, among which are sensation,
  motion, and volition, not only distinguish the animal from the plant,
  but, in proportion to their development, elevate one creature above
  another; and it is by virtue of his pre-eminent endowment, in these
  respects, that man holds his position at the head of the animal
  creation.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>3.</b> Animals whose structure is simple? As we approach man? Dependence of the animal functions of man?</div>
  <p><b>3.</b> Among animals whose structure is very simple, the hydra, or
  fresh-water polyp, being an example, no special organs are empowered to
  perform separate functions; but every part is endowed alike, so that if
  the animal be cut into pieces, each portion has all the properties of the
  entire original; and, if the circumstances be favorable, each of the
  pieces will soon become a complete hydra. As we approach man, in the
  scale of beings, we find that the organs multiply, and the functions
  become more complete. The function of motion, the instruments of
  which&mdash;the muscles and bones&mdash;have been considered in former
  chapters, and all the other animal functions of man, depend upon the set
  of organs known as the nervous system.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>4.</b> The nervous tissues, of what composed? When examined by the aid of the microscope? The white substance? The gray substance?</div>
  <p><b>4. The Nervous System.</b>&mdash;The intimate structure of this
  system differs from any tissue which we have before examined. It is
  composed of a soft, pulpy substance, which, early in life, is almost
  fluid, but which gradually hardens with the growth of the body. When
  examined under the microscope, it is found to be composed of two distinct
  elements:&mdash;(1) the white substance, composing the larger proportion
  of the nervous organs of the body, which is formed of delicate
  cylindrical filaments, about 1/6000 of an inch in diameter, termed the
  nerve-fibres; and (2) the gray substance, composed of grayish-red, or
  <!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page150"></a>{150}</span>ashen-colored cells, of various sizes,
  generally possessing one or more off-shoots, which are continuous with
  the nerve-fibres just mentioned.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>5.</b> Nervous centres and ganglia? Nerves? What do they serve? Cerebro-spinal system?</div>
  <p><b>5.</b> The gray, cellular substance constitutes the larger portion
  of those important masses, which bear the name of <i>nervous centres</i>
  and <i>ganglia</i> (from <i>ganglion</i>, a knot), and in which all the
  nerve-fibres unite. These white nerve-fibres are found combined together
  in long and dense cords, called <i>nerves</i> (from <i>neuron</i>, a
  cord), which serve to connect the nervous centres with each other, and to
  place them in communication with all the other parts of the body which
  have sensibility or power of motion. That part of the nervous system
  which is concerned in the animal functions, comprises the brain, the
  spinal cord, and the nerves which are derived therefrom; these are,
  together, called the <i>cerebro-spinal</i> system (Fig. 40); while that
  other set of organs, which presides over, and regulates the vegetative
  functions, is called the sympathetic system of nerves.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>6.</b> Location of the brain? Its weight? Its shape? Of what it consists? What organs at the base?</div>
  <p><b>6. The Brain.</b>&mdash;The brain is the great volume of nervous
  tissue that is lodged within the skull. It is the largest and most
  complex of the nervous centres, its weight, in the adult, being about
  fifty ounces, or one-fortieth of that of the whole body. The shape of the
  brain is oval, or egg-shaped, with one extremity larger than the other,
  which is placed posteriorly in the skull, to the concavity of which it
  very closely conforms. The brain consists chiefly of two parts; the
  <i>cerebrum</i>, or brain proper, and the <i>cerebellum</i>, or "little
  brain." In addition to these, there are several smaller organs at the
  base, among which is the commencement or expansion of the spinal cord,
  termed the <i>medulla oblongata</i>, or oblong marrow.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>7.</b> The tissue of the brain? What, therefore, is required? Blows on the head? Membranes of the brain? Blood sent to the brain?</div>
  <p><b>7.</b> The tissue of the brain is soft and easily altered in shape
  by pressure; it therefore requires to be placed in a well-protected
  position, such as is afforded by the skull, or <i>cranium</i>, which is
  strong without being cumbrous. In the course of an ordinary lifetime,
  this bony box sustains many blows, with little inconvenience; while, if
  they fell directly upon the brain, they would at once, and completely,
  disorganize that structure. Within the skull, the brain is enveloped by
  certain membranes, which at once protect it from friction, and furnish it
  with a supply of nutrient vessels; they are called the <i>arachnoid</i>,
  or "spider's web," the <i>dura mater</i> and the <i>pia mater</i>, or the
  "tough" and "delicate coverings." The supply of blood sent to the brain
  is very liberal, amounting to one-fifth of all that the entire body
  possesses. The brain of man is heavier than that of any other animal,

<div class="sidenotee"><b>8.</b> Size of the brain proper? How divided? The exterior of the hemispheres? The interior?</div>
  <p><b>8. The Cerebrum.</b>&mdash;The brain proper, or <i>cerebrum</i>, is
  the largest of the intracranial organs, and occupies the entire upper and
  front portion of the skull. It is almost completely bisected, by a
  fissure, or cleft, running through it lengthwise, into two equal parts
  called <i>hemispheres</i>. The exterior of these hemispheres is gray in
  color, consisting chiefly of nerve-cells, arranged so as to form a layer
  of gray matter one-fifth of an inch in thickness, and is abundantly
  supplied with blood-vessels. The interior of the brain, however, is
  composed almost wholly of white substance, or nerve-fibres.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>9.</b> The surface of the cerebrum, how marked? The gray matter of the surface? Extent of the entire brain surface? Source of nervous power? What further?</div>
  <p><b>9.</b> The surface of the cerebrum is divided by a considerable
  number of tortuous and irregular furrows, about an inch deep, into
  "convolutions," as shown in Fig. 41. Into these furrows the gray matter
  of the surface is extended, and, in this manner, its quantity is vastly
  increased. The extent of the entire surface of the brain, <!-- Page 153
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>{153}</span>with the
  convolutions unfolded, is computed to be equal to four square feet; and
  yet it is easily enclosed within the narrow limits of the skull. When it
  is stated that the gray matter is the true source of nervous power, it
  becomes evident that this arrangement has an important bearing on the
  mental capacity of the individual. And it is noticed that in children,
  before the mind is brought into vigorous use, these markings or furrows
  on the surface are comparatively shallow and indistinct; the same fact is
  true of the brain in the less civilized races of mankind and in the lower
  animals. It is also noticeable, that among animals, those are the most
  capable of being educated which have the best development of the
  cerebrum.</p>

  <p><b>10. The Cerebellum.</b>&mdash;The "little brain" is placed beneath
  the posterior part of the cerebrum, and, like the latter, is divided into
  hemispheres. Like it, also, the surface of the cerebellum is composed of
  gray matter, and its interior is chiefly white matter. It has, however,
  no convolutions, but is subdivided by many crescentic, parallel ridges,
  which, sending down gray matter deeply into the <!-- Page 154 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page154"></a>{154}</span>white, central portion,
  gives the latter a somewhat branched appearance. This peculiar appearance
  has been called the <i>arbor vitæ</i>, or the "tree of life," from the
  fact that when a section of the organ is made, it bears some resemblance
  to the trunk and branches of a tree (Fig. 42, F). In size, this
  cerebellum, or "little brain," is less than one-eighth of the
  cerebrum.</p>

  round cords of glistening white appearance, and, <!-- Page 155 --><span

  cylindrical mass of soft nervous tissue, which occupies a chamber, or
  tunnel, fashioned for it in the spinal column (Fig. 44). It is composed
  of the same substances as the brain; but the arrangement is exactly
  reversed, the white matter encompassing or surrounding the gray matter
  instead of being encompassed by it. The amount of the white substance is
  also greatly in excess of the other material. A vertical fissure partly
  separates the cord into two lateral halves, and each half is composed of
  two separate bundles of fibres, which are named the anterior and
  posterior columns.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>13.</b> Uses of these columns? Importance of this part of the nervous system? How protected?</div>
  <p><b>13.</b> These columns have entirely different uses, and each of
  them unites with a different portion of the nerves which have their
  origin in the spinal cord. The importance of this part of the nervous
  system is apparent from the extreme care taken to protect it from
  external injury. For, while a very slight disturbance of its structure
  suffices to disarm it of its power, yet so staunch is its bony enclosure,
  that only by very severe injuries is it put in peril. The three membranes
  that cover the brain are continued downward so as to envelope and still
  further shield this delicate organism.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>14.</b> The spinal nerves? The posterior root? The nerves, how arranged? Their office?</div>
  <p><b>14. The Spinal Nerves.</b>&mdash;The spinal nerves, thirty-one
  pairs in number, spring from each side of the cord by two roots, an
  anterior and a posterior root, which have the same functions as the
  columns bearing similar names. The posterior root is distinguished by
  possessing a ganglion of gray matter, and by a somewhat larger size. The
  successive points of departure, or the off-shooting of these nerves,
  occur at short and nearly regular intervals along the course of the
  spinal cord. Soon after leaving these points, <!-- Page 157 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page157"></a>{157}</span>the anterior and
  posterior roots unite to form the trunk of a nerve, which is distributed,
  by means of branches, to the various organs of that part of the body
  which this nerve is designed to serve. The spinal nerves supply chiefly
  the muscles of the trunk and limbs and the external surface of the
  body.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>15.</b> The nerve tissue? Its character? Course of each nerve fibre?</div>
  <p><b>15.</b> The tissue composing the nerves is entirely of the white
  variety, or, in other words, the nerve-fibres; the same as we have
  observed forming a part of the brain. But the nerves, instead of being
  soft and pulpy, as in the case of the brain, are dense in structure,
  being hardened and strengthened by means of a fibrous tissue which
  surrounds each of these delicate fibres, and binds them together in
  glistening, silvery bundles. Delicate and minutely fine as are these
  nerve-fibres, it is probable that each of them pursues an unbroken,
  isolated course, from its origin, in the brain or elsewhere, to that
  particular point which it is intended to serve. For, although their
  extremities are often only a hair's breadth distant from each other, the
  impression which any one of them communicates is perfectly distinct, and
  is referred to the exact point whence it came.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>16.</b> How may we illustrate the fact? The fibre connecting the brain with a point in the foot?</div>
  <p><b>16.</b> This may be illustrated in a simple manner, thus: if two
  fingers be pressed closely together, and the point of a pin be carried
  lightly across from one to the other, the eyes may be closed, and yet we
  can easily note the precise instant when the pin passes from one finger
  to the other. If the nerve-fibres were less independent, and if it were
  necessary that they should blend with and support each other, all
  accuracy of perception would be lost, and all information thus afforded
  would be pointless and confused. These silvery threads must, therefore,
  be spun out with an infinite degree of nicety. Imagine, for instance, the
  fibre which <!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page158"></a>{158}</span>connects the brain with some point on the
  foot,&mdash;its length cannot be less than one hundred thousand times
  greater than its diameter; and yet it performs its work with as much
  precision as fibres that are comparatively much stronger and less
  exposed.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>17.</b> The sympathetic system of nerves? Of what does it consist?</div>
  <p><b>17. The Sympathetic System.</b>&mdash;The <i>sympathetic system</i>
  of nerves remains to be described. It consists of a double chain of
  ganglia, situated on each side of the spinal column, and extending
  through the cavities of the trunk, and along the neck into the head.
  These ganglia are made up for the most part of small collections of gray
  nerve-cells, and are the nerve-centres of this system. From these,
  numerous small nerves are derived, which connect the ganglia together,
  send out branches to the cranial and spinal nerves, and form networks in
  the vicinity of the stomach and other large organs. A considerable
  portion of them also follows the distribution of the large and small
  blood-vessels, in which the muscular tunic appears. Branches also ascend
  into the head, and supply the muscles of the eye and ear, and other
  organs of sense.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>18.</b> Association of the various regions of the body? If one member suffers? Blushing?</div>
  <p><b>18.</b> In this manner, the various regions of the body are
  associated with each other by a nervous apparatus, which is only
  indirectly connected with the brain and spinal cord; and thus it is
  arranged that the most widely separated organs of the body are brought
  into close and active sympathy with each other, so that, "if one member
  suffers, all the other members suffer with it." From this fact, the name
  <i>sympathetic system</i>, or the <i>great sympathetic nerve</i>, has
  been given to the complicated apparatus we have briefly described.
  Blushing and pallor are caused by mental emotions, as modesty and fear,
  which produce opposite conditions of the capillaries of the face by means
  of these sympathetic nerves. <!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page159"></a>{159}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>19.</b> Properties of nervous tissue? Office of the gray substance? Of the white? The nervous centres? White fibres?</div>
  <p><b>19. The Properties of Nervous Tissue.</b>&mdash;We have seen that
  in all parts of this system, there are only two forms of nervous tissue;
  namely, the gray substance and the white substance, so called from their
  difference of color as seen by the naked eye; or the nerve-cell, and the
  nerve-fibre, so called from their microscopic appearance. Now these two
  tissues are not commonly mingled together, but either form separate
  organs, or distinct parts of the same organs. This leads us to the
  conclusion that their respective uses are distinct. And this proves to be
  the simple fact; wherever we find the gray substance, we must look upon
  it as performing an active part in the system, that is, it originates
  nervous impulses; the white matter, on the contrary, is a passive agent,
  and serves merely as a conductor of nervous influences. Accordingly, the
  nervous centres, composed so largely of the gray cells, are the great
  centres of power, and the white fibres are simply the instruments by
  which the former communicate with the near and distant regions of the
  body under their control.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>20.</b> What comparison is made between the brain and the nation's capitol? The vital property, excitability? What example is given?</div>
  <p><b>20.</b> We may compare the brain, then, to the capital, or seat of
  government, while the various ganglia, including the gray matter of the
  cord, like so many subordinate official posts, are invested with
  authority over the outlying provinces; and the nerves, with the white
  matter of the cord, are the highways over which messages go and return
  between these provinces and the local or central governments. But both
  forms of nervous tissue possess the same vital property, called
  excitability; by which term is meant, that when a nerve-cell or fibre is
  stimulated by some external agent, it is capable of receiving an
  impression and of being by it excited into activity. A ray of light, for
  example, falling upon one extremity of a fibre in the eye, excites it
  throughout its whole length; and its <!-- Page 160 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page160"></a>{160}</span>other extremity, within
  the brain, communicating with a nerve-cell, the latter, in its turn, is
  excited, and the sensation of sight is produced.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>21.</b> Change in the nervous tissues? Nerve force and electricity?</div>
  <p><b>21.</b> What sort of change takes place in the nervous tissue when
  its excitability is aroused, is not known; certainly none is visible. On
  this account, it has been thought by some, that the nerve-fibre acts
  after the manner of a telegraph wire; that is, it transmits its messages
  without undergoing any material change of form. But, though the
  comparison is a convenient one, it is far from being strictly applicable;
  and the notion that nerve-force is identical with electricity has been
  fully proved to be incorrect.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>22.</b> Functions of the nerves? In the case of the nerve of a living animal? Of the human body?</div>
  <p><b>22. The Functions of the Nerves.</b>&mdash;The nerves are the
  instruments of the two grand functions of the nervous system, Sensation
  and Motion. They are not the true centres of either function, but they
  are the conductors of influences which occasion both. If the nerve in a
  limb of a living animal be laid bare, and irritated by pinching,
  galvanizing, or the like, two results follow, namely: the animal
  experiences a sensation, that of pain, in the part to which the nerve is
  distributed, and the limb is thrown into convulsive action. When a nerve
  in a human body is cut by accident, or destroyed by disease, the part in
  which it ramifies loses both sensation and power of motion; or, in other
  words, it is paralyzed. We accordingly say that the nerves have a twofold
  use, a <i>sensory</i> and <i>motor</i> function.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>23.</b> If an exposed nerve be divided? What is proved? The course of the sensory set of fibres? Of the motor set? To what are they likened?</div>
  <p><b>23.</b> If a nerve that has been exposed be divided, and the inner
  end, or that still in connection with the nerve-centres, be irritated,
  sensation is produced, but no movement takes place. But if the outer end,
  or that still connected with the limb, be irritated, then no pain is
  felt, but <!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page161"></a>{161}</span>muscular contractions are produced. Thus
  we prove that there are two distinct sets of fibres in the nerves; one of
  which, the <i>sensory</i> fibres, conduct toward the brain, and another,
  the <i>motor</i> fibres, conduct to the muscles. The former may be said
  to begin in the skin and other organs, and end in the brain; while the
  latter begin in the nervous centres and end in the muscles. They are like
  a double line of telegraph wires, one for inquiries, the other for
  responses.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>24.</b> The two roots of the spinal nerves? What has been found? Difference of the two sorts of fibres? Result of their union?</div>
  <p><b>24.</b> We have already spoken of the two roots of the spinal
  nerves, called from their points of origin in the spinal cord, the
  anterior and posterior roots. These have been separately cut and
  irritated in the living animal, and it has been found that the posterior
  root contains only sensory fibres, and the anterior root has only motor
  fibres. So that the nerves of a limb may be injured in such a way that it
  will retain power of motion and yet lose sensation; or the reverse
  condition, feeling without motion, may exist. Between these two sorts of
  fibres, no difference of structure can be found; and where they have
  joined to form a nerve it is impossible to distinguish one sort from the
  other.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>25.</b> Transient paralysis? When such is the case with the leg? What other fact is observed?</div>
  <p><b>25.</b> Occasionally a nerve is so compressed as to be temporarily
  unable to perform its functions: a transient paralysis then takes place.
  This is the case when the leg or arm "gets asleep," as it is expressed.
  When such is the condition with the leg, and the person suddenly attempts
  to walk, he is liable to fall, inasmuch as the motor fibres cannot convey
  orders to the muscles of the limb. Another fact is observed: there is no
  sensation in this nerve at the point of its compression; but the whole
  limb is numb, and tingling sensations are felt in the foot, the point
  from which the sensory fibres arise.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>26.</b> What does this illustrate? Sensation? The feeling after a limb has been amputated? Striking of the "funny bone?"</div>
  <p><b>26.</b> This illustrates the manner in which the brain <!-- Page
  162 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162"></a>{162}</span>interprets
  all injuries of the trunk of a nerve. Sensation or pain is not felt at
  the point of injury, but is referred to the outer extremities of the
  nerve, where impressions are habitually received. This is the reason why,
  after a limb has been amputated by the surgeon, the patient appears to
  suffer pain in the member that has been severed from the body; while some
  form of irritation at the end of the nerve in the wound, or stump, is the
  real source of his distress. Again, when the "funny-bone"&mdash;that is,
  the ulnar nerve at the elbow,&mdash;is accidentally struck, the tingling
  sensations thus produced are referred to the outer side of the hand and
  the little finger, the parts to which that nerve is distributed.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>27.</b> The spinal nerves, and two from the brain? Of the remainder? Difference in the nerves? How accounted for? The rate of conduction along a nerve? As compared with electricity?</div>
  <p><b>27.</b> All the spinal nerves, and two from the brain, are
  concerned in both sensation and motion. Of the remainder of the cranial
  nerves, some are exclusively motor, others exclusively sensory; and still
  others convey, not ordinary sensations, but special impressions, such as
  sight, hearing, and smell, which we have yet to consider. However much
  the functions of the nerves seem to vary, there is but little difference
  discoverable in the nerves themselves, when examined under the
  microscope. Whatever difference exists must be accounted for in
  consequence of the nerves communicating with different portions of the
  gray matter of the brain. The rate of motion of a message, to or from the
  brain along a nerve, has been measured by experiment upon the lower
  animals, and estimated in the case of man at about two hundred feet per
  second. As compared with that of electricity, this is a very slow rate,
  but, in respect to the size of the human body, it is practically
  instantaneous.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>28.</b> Functions of the anterior and posterior columns of the cord? If the cord be divided?</div>
  <p><b>28. The Functions of the Spinal Cord.</b>&mdash;As the <!-- Page
  163 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>{163}</span>anterior
  and posterior roots of the spinal nerves have separate functions, so the
  anterior and posterior columns of the cord are distinct in function. The
  former are concerned in the production of motion, the latter in
  sensation. If the cord be divided, as before in the case of the nerve, it
  is found that the parts below the point of injury are deprived of
  sensation and of the power of voluntary motion on both sides of the body,
  a form of paralysis which is called <i>paraplegia</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>29.</b> Paraplegia? Result and danger to life? When the injury occurs in the neck?</div>
  <p><b>29.</b> This form of disease, paraplegia, is sometimes seen among
  men, generally as the result of a fall, or some other severe accident, by
  which the bones of the spine are broken, and the cord is crushed, or
  pierced by fragments of bone. The parts which are supplied by nerves from
  the cord above the point of injury are as sensitive and mobile as before.
  The results are similar, whether the division happens at a higher or
  lower portion of the spinal cord; but the danger to life increases
  proportionally as the injury approaches the brain. When it occurs in the
  neck, the muscles of inspiration are paralyzed, since they are supplied
  by nerves issuing from that region; and as a result of this paralysis,
  the lungs are unable to act, and life is speedily brought to a close.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>30.</b> Experiment of cutting the spinal cord of an animal? What inference is drawn?</div>
  <p><b>30.</b> When the spinal cord of an animal has been cut, in
  experiment, it may be irritated in a manner similar to that alluded to
  when considering the nerves. If, then, the upper cut surface be excited,
  it is found that pain, referable to the parts below the cut, is produced;
  but when the lower cut surface is irritated, no feeling is manifested. So
  we conclude that in respect to sensation, the spinal cord is not its true
  centre, but that it is merely a conductor, and is therefore the great
  sensory nerve of the body. When the lower surface of the cut is
  irritated, the muscles of the <!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page164"></a>{164}</span>parts below the section are violently
  contracted. Hence, we conclude that, in respect to the movements ordered
  by the will, the spinal cord is not their source; but that it acts only
  as a conductor, and is, accordingly, the great motor nerve of the
  body.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>31.</b> What singular fact is noticed? What does the result show?</div>
  <p><b>31. Direction of the Fibres of the Cord.</b>&mdash;If one lateral
  half of the spinal cord be cut, or injured, a very singular fact is
  observed. All voluntary power over the muscles of the corresponding half
  of the body is lost, but the sensibility of that side remains
  undiminished. This result seems to show that the motor fibres of the cord
  pursue a direct course, while its sensory fibres are bent from their
  course. And this has been proved to be the fact; for immediately after
  the posterior roots&mdash;the conductors of sensory
  impressions&mdash;join the posterior columns, they enter the gray matter
  of the cord, and passing over, ascend to the brain on the opposite side.
  Accordingly, the sensory fibres from the right and left sides interlace
  each other in the gray matter; this arrangement has been termed the
  <i>decussation</i>, or crossing of these fibres. This condition serves to
  explain how a disease or injury of the cord may cause a paralysis of
  motion in one leg, and a loss of sensation in the other.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>32.</b> Direction of the anterior or motor columns? In the cord itself? In the medulla oblongata? The decussation?</div>
  <p><b>32.</b> The direction of the anterior, or motor columns of the
  cord, is downward from the brain. In the cord itself, the course of the
  motor fibres is for the most part, a direct one; but in the medulla
  oblongata, or upper extremity of the cord, and therefore early in their
  career, these fibres decussate, or cross from side to side in a mass; and
  not separately, as in the case of the posterior fibres just mentioned.
  This arrangement is termed the <i>decussation</i> of the anterior columns
  of the medulla.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>33.</b> Result of the double interlacing of fibres? Where is the seat of pain when the right hand is hurt? The moving of the foot? Loss of sensation in one side of the body?</div>
  <p><b>33.</b> From this double interlacing of fibres results a <!-- Page
  165 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>{165}</span>crossed
  action between the original and terminal extremity of all nerve-fibres
  which pass through the medulla; namely, those of all the spinal nerves.
  Consequently, if the right hand be hurt, the left side of the brain feels
  the pain; and if the left foot move, it is the right hemisphere which
  dictates its movement. For the same reason, when a loss of sensation and
  power of motion affecting the right side of the body alone is observed,
  the physiologist understands that the brain has been invaded by disease
  upon its left side. This affection is termed <i>hemiplegia</i>, or the
  "half-stroke." The full-stroke, which often follows the rupture of a
  blood-vessel in the brain, is commonly called <i>paralysis</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>34.</b> What other important use has the cord? What is the activity denominated?</div>
  <p><b>34. The Reflex Action of the Cord.</b>&mdash;We have already
  considered the cord as the great motor and sensory nerve of the body, but
  it has another and extremely important use. By virtue of the gray matter,
  which occupies its central portion, it plays the part of an independent
  nerve centre. The spinal cord not only conducts some impressions to the
  brain, but it also arrests others; and, as it is expressed, "reflects"
  them into movements by its own power. This mode of nervous activity is
  denominated the <i>Reflex Action</i> of the cord.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>35.</b> Example of the fowl? Centipede? Frog? What do they prove?</div>
  <p><b>35.</b> A familiar example of this power of the cord is found in
  the violent movements which agitate a fowl after its head has been cut
  off. The cold-blooded animals also exhibit reflex movements in an
  astonishing degree. A decapitated centipede will run rapidly forward, and
  will seemingly strive to overturn, or else climb over obstacles placed in
  its way. A frog similarly mutilated will sustain its headless body upon
  its feet, in the standing posture, just as it might do if it were still
  alive. If pushed over, it will regain its feet; and if the feet are
  irritated, it will <!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page166"></a>{166}</span>jump forward. There can be no doubt that,
  in the lower animals, movements may take place which are completely
  divorced from the will, sensation, and consciousness; for in those
  animals, as well as in man, these faculties have their principal seat
  within the brain.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>36.</b> What is necessary in most cases to awaken reflex movements? In the case of the fowl? Convulsions which follow decapitation?</div>
  <p><b>36.</b> An irritation is necessary, in most instances, to awaken
  reflex movements. In the case of the decapitated fowl, its muscles are
  excited to convulsive action by reason of its being thrown upon the hard
  ground and roughly handled. Let it be treated differently, and the
  convulsions will not take place: let it be laid gently upon soft cotton,
  and the body will remain comparatively quiet. It may comfort some people
  to know that the convulsions which follow decapitation are not attended
  with pain; nor are they a necessary part of the "act of death," as some
  suppose.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>37.</b> Actions in the human body distinct from voluntary efforts?</div>
  <p><b>37.</b> In the human body, likewise, actions are excited that are
  entirely distinct from the ordinary voluntary efforts. It is not
  permissible, desirable, nor even necessary to decapitate a man that the
  body may be disconnected from his brain, in order to test the effect of
  irritation upon the spinal cord; although the bodies of beheaded
  criminals have been experimented upon, and caused to move by powerful
  galvanic batteries. The resort to such means of experiment is rendered
  unnecessary by the occurrence of certain deplorable cases of disease and
  injury, which effectually sever all communication between the brain and a
  large part of the body.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>38.</b> Reflex action after injury of the cord? Why not due to the muscles?</div>
  <p><b>38.</b> Thus, the cord may be so far injured, as the result of
  accident, as to terminate all sensation and voluntary motion in the lower
  half of the body, the patient seemingly becoming lifeless and powerless
  from the waist downward. And yet, by tickling or pinching either foot,
  the leg <!-- Page 167 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page167"></a>{167}</span>of the same side may be made to jerk, or
  even to kick with considerable force; but, unless the patient is
  observing his limbs, he is wholly unconscious of these movements, which
  are, therefore, performed independently of the brain. And they are in
  nowise due to the muscles of the limb; for, if the cord itself becomes
  diseased below the point of injury, the muscles cease to contract.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>39.</b> What are the requisites for the production of this form of nervous action?</div>
  <p><b>39.</b> For the production of this form of nervous action three
  things are requisite&mdash;(1) a nerve to conduct messages from the
  surface of the body, one of that variety formerly described as sensory,
  but which are now incapable of awakening sensation; (2) a portion of
  uninjured spinal cord which shall reflect or convert impressions into
  impulses; and (3) a motor nerve to conduct impulses outward to the
  muscles. The power of the cord to enforce reflex acts resides in the gray
  matter, into which the reflex nerves enter and from which they depart, by
  means of their posterior and anterior roots respectively.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>40.</b> Why do we not readily recognize the reflex activity of the cord in our own bodies? How best studied in others? Example?</div>
  <p><b>40. The Uses of the Reflex Action.</b>&mdash;The reflex activity of
  the cord is exhibited in the healthy body in many ways, but since it is
  never accompanied with sensation, we do not readily recognize it in our
  own bodies. Reflex movements are best studied in the cases of other
  persons, when the conditions enable us to distinguish between acts that
  are consciously, and those that are unconsciously performed. For example,
  if the foot of a person soundly asleep be tickled or pinched, it will be
  quickly withdrawn from the irritation.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>41.</b> Similar movements? Arm of a person? Melted wax or heated coin on the hand?</div>
  <p><b>41.</b> Similar movements may be observed in cases where the
  consciousness and sensation are temporarily obliterated by disease, or by
  means of narcotic poisons. If the arm of a person who has been rendered
  insensible by <!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page168"></a>{168}</span>chloroform, be raised, and then allowed to
  fall, it will be noticed that the limb does not drop instantly, like a
  lifeless member, but a certain amount of rigidity remains in its muscles,
  which resists or breaks the force of its descent. Again, when a substance
  like melted sealing-wax, or a heated coin, falls upon the hand, the limb
  is snatched away at once, even before the feeling of pain has been
  recognized by the brain. When jolted in a rapidly moving car, we
  involuntarily step forward or backward, so as to preserve the centre of
  gravity of the body.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>42.</b> Result of healthful reflex activity? When may the reflex energy be deficient?</div>
  <p><b>42.</b> These and similar acts are executed by the same mechanism
  as that previously described in the case of paralysis from an injury of
  the spinal cord. The muscles thus called into play, are those which are
  ordinarily under the sway of the will, but which in these cases act
  through this reflex action of the cord, altogether independently of the
  will. A healthful reflex activity produces an elasticity, or "tone," of
  the voluntary muscular system, which, in a great measure, explains the
  existence in the young and vigorous of a feeling of buoyancy and reserve
  power. Its possessor is restlessly active, and it may appropriately be
  said of him, "he rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race." But this
  reflex energy may be deficient. This is true when the blood is poor and
  wanting in its solid ingredients, or the circulation is feeble; the
  muscles, then, are flabby and weak, and the person himself is said to be
  "nerveless," or indisposed to exertion. Shivering from cold, and
  trembling from fear, may, in part, be referred to a temporary loss of
  tone, resulting from a powerful impression upon the brain.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>43.</b> Excess of this activity in disease? Hydrophobia, etc.? The difference in severity of the convulsions?</div>
  <p><b>43.</b> An excess of this activity may also be observed in disease.
  In this condition, the excitability of the cord is unnaturally aroused,
  and frequent and violent movements <!-- Page 169 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page169"></a>{169}</span>of the limbs and body,
  called convulsions, are the result. The convulsions of young children,
  and the nervous agitation of <i>chorea</i>, or St. Vitus's dance, are
  reflex in character; as are also the symptoms attending poisoning by
  strychnine, and those terrible diseases, <i>tetanus</i>, or "locked jaw,"
  and <i>hydrophobia</i>. The severity of the convulsions is not the same
  in all cases of these disorders; but, in those last mentioned the most
  violent spasmodic movements are provoked by the slightest form of
  irritation&mdash;such as the sound of pouring water, the sight of any
  glittering object, the glancing of a mirror, the contact of cool air, or
  even the touch of the bedclothes.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>44.</b> Another variety of reflex motions? What are they? What is stated of the mind in connection with these movements?</div>
  <p><b>44.</b> Another variety of reflex motions takes place in certain
  involuntary muscles, and over these the cord exercises supreme control.
  They are principally those movements which aid the performance of
  digestion and nutrition, the valve-action of the pylorus, and other
  movements of the stomach and intestines. In these movements the mind
  shares no part. And it is well that this is so; for since the mind is
  largely occupied with affairs external to the body, it acts irregularly,
  becomes fatigued, and needs frequent rest. The spinal cord, on the
  contrary, is well fitted for the form of work on which depends the growth
  and support of the body, as it acts uniformly, and with a machine-like
  regularity.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>45.</b> Consciousness in these operations? Physical wants?</div>
  <p><b>45.</b> These operations are not accompanied by consciousness; for,
  as a general rule, the attention is only called to them when they become
  disordered. Many a person does not know where his stomach is situated,
  until he discovers its position by reason of a feeling of distress within
  it, produced by giving that organ improper work to perform. In this
  manner the higher and nobler faculties of the mind are liberated from the
  simply routine duties of the <!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page170"></a>{170}</span>body; and we are thus left to direct the
  attention, the reason, and the will to the accomplishment of the great
  ends of our existence. If it were otherwise, we could only find time to
  attend to our ordinary physical wants.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>46.</b> How many objects may the reflex activity be said to have? State the first. The second. The third.</div>
  <p><b>46.</b> The objects of the reflex activity of the cord are
  threefold. In the first place, it acts as the protector of man, in his
  unconscious moments. It is his unseen guardian, always ready to act,
  never growing weary, and never requiring sleep. Nor does its faithful
  action wholly cease with the cessation of life in other parts. In the
  second place, it is the regulator of numerous involuntary motions that
  are necessary to the nutrition of the body. Here its actions are entirely
  independent of the brain, and are performed in a secret and automatic
  manner. And, thirdly, it acts as a substitute, and regulates involuntary
  movements in the muscles usually under the influence of the will. It thus
  takes the place of the higher faculties in performing habitual acts, and
  permits them to extend their operations more and more beyond the body and
  its material wants.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>47.</b> How does the medulla oblongata resemble the cord?</div>
  <p><b>47. The Functions of the Medulla Oblongata.</b>&mdash;The
  prolongation of the spinal cord, within the skull, has been previously
  spoken of as the medulla oblongata. It resembles the cord, in being
  composed of both white and gray matter, and in conducting sensory and
  motor influences. It likewise gives rise to certain nerves, which are
  here called cranial nerves (from <i>cranium</i>, the skull). All except
  two of these important nerves spring from the medulla, or the parts
  immediately adjoining it; the exceptions are the two nerves taking part
  in the special senses of sight and smell, which nerves have their origin
  at the base of the cerebrum.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>48.</b> What final fact is observed in the crossing of the motor columns?</div>
  <p><b>48.</b> The decussation, or crossing of the motor columns, has been
  previously described, when treating of the <!-- Page 171 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>{171}</span>direction of the
  nerve-fibres of the cord; and the singular fact has been alluded to, that
  when one side of the brain is injured, its effects are limited to the
  opposite side of the body. One more fact remains to be observed in this
  connection, namely, this crossed action does not usually take place in
  the cranial nerves. Accordingly, when apoplexy, or the rupture of a
  blood-vessel, occurs in the right hemisphere of the cerebrum, the left
  side of the body is paralyzed, but the right side of the face is
  affected; this is because that part of the body is supplied by the
  cranial nerves.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>49.</b> The pneumogastric nerve? The feelings aroused by it? The "vital knot?"</div>
  <p><b>49.</b> A portion of the medulla presides over the important
  function of respiration, and from it arises the <i>pneumogastric</i>
  nerve, so called because its branches serve both the lungs and stomach.
  The feelings of hunger, thirst, and the desire for air are aroused by
  means of this nerve. The wounding of the gray matter of the medulla, even
  of a small portion of it, near the origin of the pneumogastric nerve, at
  once stops the action of the lungs and causes death. In consequence of
  the importance of this part, it has been termed the "vital knot." We
  find, also, that its location within the skull is exceedingly well
  protected, it being quite beyond the reach of any ordinary form of harm
  from without.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>50.</b> The uses of the smaller gray masses at the base of the brain?</div>
  <p><b>50. The Functions of the Cranial Ganglia.</b>&mdash;The uses of the
  smaller gray masses lying at the base of the brain are not well
  ascertained; and, on account of their position, so remote from the
  surface, it would, at first, seem well-nigh impossible to study them.
  But, from the results following diseases in these parts, and from
  experiments upon inferior animals, they are becoming gradually better
  understood; and there is reason to believe that eventually the
  physiological office of each part will be clearly ascertained and
  defined. It is believed, however, but not <!-- Page 172 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page172"></a>{172}</span>absolutely proven, that
  the anterior masses, like the anterior roots of the spinal nerves and the
  anterior columns of the cord, are concerned in the production of motion;
  in fact, that they are the central organs of that function. The posterior
  gray masses are, on the contrary, supposed to be the seat of
  sensation.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>51.</b> Function of the cerebellum? When it is diseased?</div>
  <p><b>51. The Function of the Cerebellum.</b>&mdash;The function of the
  cerebellum, or "little brain," is the direction of the movements of the
  voluntary muscles. When this organ is the seat of disease or injury, it
  is usually observed that the person is unable to execute orderly and
  regular acts, but moves in a confused manner as if in a state of
  intoxication. Like the larger brain, or cerebrum, it appears to be devoid
  of feeling; but it takes no part in the operations of the mind.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>52.</b> Where is the seat of the mind? The subordination of the other organs? The gray matter?</div>
  <p><b>52. The Function of the Cerebrum.</b>&mdash;The cerebrum, or brain
  proper, is the seat of the mind; or, speaking more exactly, it is the
  material instrument by which the mind acts; and, as it occupies the
  highest position in the body, so it fulfils the loftiest uses. All the
  other organs are subordinate to it: the senses are its messengers, which
  bring it information from the outer world, and the organs of motion are
  its servants, which execute its commands. Here, as in the nervous
  apparatus of lower grade already considered, the gray matter is the
  element of power; and, in proportion as this substance increases in
  extent, and in proportion to the number of convolutions in the
  hemispheres, do the mental faculties expand.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>53.</b> What is stated of men in connection with the size of their brain? With the brains of other animals?</div>
  <p><b>53.</b> There have been a few, but only a few, men of distinguished
  ability whose brains have been comparatively small in size; the rule
  being that great men possess large brains. The relative weight of the
  brain of man, as <!-- Page 173 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page173"></a>{173}</span>compared with the weight of the body, does
  not, in all instances, exceed that of the inferior animals; the canary
  and other singing-birds have a greater relative amount of nervous matter
  than man; but man surpasses all other creatures in the size of the
  hemispheres of the cerebrum, and in the amount of gray substance which
  they contain.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>54.</b> Sensitiveness of the brain substance? The removal of a portion of the brain? State the remarkable case mentioned?</div>
  <p><b>54.</b> It is a singular fact that this cerebral substance is
  insensitive, and may be cut without causing pain. The removal of a
  considerable quantity of the brain has taken place, as the result of
  accident, without causing death, and without even affecting seriously the
  intellect. A remarkable case of injury of the brain is recorded, in
  which, from the accidental explosion of gunpowder used in blasting a
  rock, the "tamping-iron" was driven directly through the skull of a man.
  This iron rod, three feet and seven inches long, an inch and a quarter in
  diameter, and weighing more than thirteen pounds, entered the head below
  the ear and passed out at the top of the skull, carrying with it portions
  of the brain and fragments of bone. The man sustained the loss of sight
  on one side, but otherwise recovered his health and the use of his
  faculties. Moreover, disease has occurred, compromising a large portion
  of the brain, without impairing the faculties of the mind, when the
  disease was limited to one side only.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>55.</b> Thought, emotion, and will? What power do they give us?</div>
  <p><b>55.</b> Impressions conveyed to the hemispheres from the external
  world arouse the mental operations called thought, emotion, and the will.
  These are the godlike attributes which enable man to subjugate a world,
  and afterward cause him to "sigh for other worlds to conquer;" which
  enable him to acquaint himself with the properties of planets millions of
  miles distant from him, and which give him that creative power by which
  he builds and peoples the new worlds of poetry and art. <!-- Page 174
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>{174}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>56.</b> Are the brain and the mind identical?</div>
  <p><b>56.</b> All these mental acts, and many others, are developed
  through the action of the brain; not that the brain and the mind are the
  same, or that the brain secretes memory, imagination, or the ideas of
  truth and justice, as the stomach secretes the gastric juice. But rather,
  as the nerve of the eye, stimulated by the subtile waves of light,
  occasions the notion of color, so the brain, called into action by the
  mysterious influences of the immaterial soul, gives rise to all the
  intellectual, emotional, and voluntary activities of mankind.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>57.</b> What do we know of the cerebrum and its powers?</div>
  <p><b>57.</b> The cerebrum, according to our present knowledge of it,
  must be regarded as a single organ, which produces different results,
  according as it is acted upon by the immaterial mind in different ways.
  Recent investigations, however, seem to prove that the faculty of
  language is dependent upon a small part of the left hemisphere of the
  cerebrum, near the temple. At least, in almost every instance where this
  part is diseased, the patient can no longer express himself in speech and
  writing.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>58.</b> The reflex function of the organs within the skull? The reflex power of the medulla? Respiration?</div>
  <p><b>58. The Reflex Action of the Brain.</b>&mdash;The reflex function
  of the organs within the skull is very active and important. Like that of
  the cord, it protects the body by involuntary movements, it regulates the
  so-called vegetative acts, and it takes the place of the will in
  controlling the voluntary muscles, when the attention is turned in other
  directions. The reflex power of the medulla governs the acts of
  respiration, which are absolutely and continuously essential to life.
  Respiration is, as we have seen, partly under the influence of the will;
  but this is due in part to the fact that respiration is indirectly
  concerned in one of the animal functions, that of speech.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>59.</b> What else does reflex action occasion? Winking? Other examples?</div>
  <p><b>59.</b> Reflex action also occasions coughing and sneezing, <!--
  Page 175 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page175"></a>{175}</span>whenever improper substances enter the
  air-passages. Winking is an act of the same sort, and serves both to
  shield the eyes from too great glare of light, and to preserve them by
  keeping the cornea moist. Looking at the sun or other strong light,
  causes sneezing by reflex action. Laughing, whether caused by tickling
  the feet or by some happy thought, and also sobbing, are reflex acts,
  taking place by means of the respiratory muscles.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>60.</b> Muscles called into play by certain reflex movements? The somnambulist?</div>
  <p><b>60.</b> Certain of the protective reflex movements call into play a
  large number of muscles, as in the balancing of the body when walking
  along a narrow ledge, or on a slippery pavement. The dodging motion of
  the recruit, when the first cannon ball passes over his head, is reflex
  and involuntary. The fact that these involuntary, reflex acts are
  performed with great precision, will explain why it is that accidents
  seldom befall the somnambulist, or sleep-walker, although he often
  ventures in most perilous places.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>61.</b> What is said of walking and other acts in connection with the office performed by the medulla and spinal cord?</div>
  <p><b>61.</b> Walking, sitting, and other acts of daily life, become
  automatic, or reflex, from habit: the mind is seldom directed to them,
  but delegates their control to the medulla and spinal cord. Thus a person
  in walking, may traverse several miles while absorbed in thought, or in
  argument with a companion, and yet be conscious of scarcely one in a
  thousand of the acts that have been necessary to carry his body from one
  point to another. By this admirable and beautiful provision, the mind is
  released from the charge of the ordinary mechanical acts of life, and may
  devote itself to the exercise of its nobler faculties. And it is worthy
  of notice, that the greater the use of these faculties, the more work
  does the reflex function assume and perform; and thus the employment of
  the one insures the improvement of the other. <!-- Page 176 --><span

</blockquote>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>1.</b> True centre of sensation? Place of the mind's impressions? What is it convenient to say? What further is stated?</div>
  <p><b>1. Production of Sensations.</b>&mdash;We have already seen that
  the true centre of sensation is some organ within the skull, probably
  among the gray masses at the base of the brain; but the mind never
  perceives impressions at that point; but, on the contrary, always refers
  them to the external organs of sensation. Hence, it is convenient to say,
  that those outer parts possess the property of sensibility. For instance,
  we say that we hear with the ear, taste with the tongue, and feel with
  the fingers. That this is not the exact truth is proven by the fact, that
  whenever the nerve connecting one of these organs with the brain is
  severed, it at once loses its capacity for sensation.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>2.</b> Consciousness? During sleep? In profound insensibility?</div>
  <p><b>2.</b> Consciousness, another faculty of the brain, is necessary to
  complete a sensation. During sleep, and in other unconscious states, the
  usual impressions are presented to <!-- Page 178 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>{178}</span>the ear, the nose, and
  the skin, but they fail to excite sensations, because the nerve-centres
  are inactive. In profound insensibility, from chloroform or ether, a limb
  may be removed without occasioning the least feeling.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>3.</b> Sensibility in animals? In the earth-worm? In man?</div>
  <p><b>3. Variety of Sensations.</b>&mdash;All animals have some degree of
  sensibility. It is of course feeble and indistinct in the lower forms of
  life, but increases in power and variety as we ascend the scale. In the
  earth-worm, the nervous system is very simple, the sensibility being
  moderate and alike in all parts: hence, if its body be cut into two
  pieces, each piece will have the same degree of feeling as before. As we
  approach man, however, the sensations multiply and become more acute; the
  organs are more complex, and special parts are endowed with special
  gifts. These special organs cannot be separated from the rest of the body
  without the loss of the functions they are designed to exercise.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>4.</b> The lowest form of sensation? The highest? Sensations, how modified? What further can you state as to habitual impressions?</div>
  <p><b>4.</b> The lowest form of sensation, that of simple contact, is
  possessed by the lowest of the animal creation. The highest forms are
  those by which we are enabled to know the properties of external objects,
  such as shape, size, sound, and color. A variety of means of
  communicating with the outer world is the necessary possession of a high
  intelligence. Sensations are modified by use. They become more acute and
  powerful by moderate exercise; or, they are dulled by undue excitement.
  The former is shown by the acute hearing of the Indian, by the sharp
  sight of the sailor, and by the delicate touch of the blind. The latter
  is exemplified by the impaired hearing of the boiler-maker, and the
  depraved taste of him who uses pungent condiments with his food. Again,
  impressions habitually presented may not be consciously felt; as is the
  case with the rumbling of carriages in a neighboring <!-- Page 179
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"></a>{179}</span>street, or the
  regular ticking of a clock. All sensations become less vivid with the
  advance of age, especially hearing and vision.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>5.</b> General sensibility? What have we seen as regards the brain? Of what other structures is the same true?</div>
  <p><b>5. General Sensibility.</b>&mdash;There is a property possessed by
  nearly all parts of the human body which we call general sensibility. We
  have recently seen that the brain is wholly insensitive, and may be cut
  or pinched without pain. The same is true of the nails, hair, the
  scarf-skin or external covering of the body, and a few other structures.
  In these parts no nerves are found. On the other hand, the sensibility of
  the true skin, and of mucous membranes, as of the eye and nose, is
  exquisite, these organs having a large supply of sensory nerve-fibres.
  The bones and tendons have less of these fibres, and are only moderately
  sensitive.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>6.</b> The cause of sensibility? Painful part in a surgical operation? Benumbing the surface? How done by ether?</div>
  <p><b>6.</b> The sensibility of any part of the body, then, depends upon
  the number of nerves present; and, as a rule, the nervous supply is
  proportional to the importance of the part, and to its liability to
  injury. When, therefore, a surgical operation is performed, the most
  painful part of it is the incision through the skin; the muscles,
  cartilage, and bone being comparatively without sensation. Hence, if we
  could benumb the surface, certain of the lesser operations might be
  undergone without great inconvenience. This is, in fact, very
  successfully accomplished by means of the cold produced by throwing a
  spray of ether, or of some other rapidly evaporating liquid, upon the
  part to be cut.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>7.</b> Tickling? Internal sensations? The nerves of general sensibility?</div>
  <p><b>7.</b> Tickling is a modification of general sensibility. At first,
  it excites a pleasurable sensation, but this soon passes into pain. It is
  only present in those parts where the sense of touch is feeble. But all
  impressions are not received from without: there are, also, certain
  internal <!-- Page 180 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page180"></a>{180}</span>sensations, as they are called, which
  depend upon the condition of the internal organs, such as appetite,
  hunger, thirst, the sense of satisfaction after taking food, dizziness
  when looking down from some lofty position, lassitude, drowsiness,
  fatigue, and other feelings of comfort or discomfort. General
  sensibility, whether of the internal or external organs of the body,
  chiefly depends upon the sensory fibres of the spinal nerve. The face,
  however, is supplied by the sensory cranial nerves. The sympathetic
  system has a low grade of feeling in health; but disease in the parts
  served by it arouses an intense degree of pain.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>8.</b> Connection between pain and sensibility?</div>
  <p><b>8. The Sensation of Pain.</b>&mdash;What then is <i>pain</i>? Is it
  identical with ordinary sensibility? There seems to be some necessary
  connection between the two feelings, for they take place through the same
  channels, and they are alike intense in the same situations. But
  sensibility habitually contributes to our sources of pleasure, the very
  opposite of pain; hence, these feelings cannot be identical.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>9.</b> Explain the difference between pain and sensibility.</div>
  <p><b>9.</b> Pain must, therefore, be a modification of the general
  sensibility, which follows an excessive degree of excitement of the
  nerves; there being a natural limit to the amount of stimulation which
  they will sustain. So long as this limit is observed, the part excited
  may be said to be simply sensitive; but when it is exceeded, the
  impression becomes painful. This difference between sensibility and pain
  is well shown by the effects of sunlight upon the eye. The indirect
  illumination of the sun arouses only the former feeling, and is
  indispensable to our comfort and existence; while the direct ray received
  into the eye occasions great pain.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>10.</b> Dread of pain? How may its value be appreciated? Example.</div>
  <p><b>10. The Uses of Pain.</b>&mdash;The dread of pain is a valuable
  monitor to the body. It puts us on our guard in the presence of danger;
  teaches moderation in the use of our <!-- Page 181 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>{181}</span>powers; indicates the
  approach of disease; and calls attention to it when present. The word
  disease, in fact, according to its original use, had reference simply to
  the pain, or want of ease, which commonly attends disordered health. When
  we observe the serious mishaps which occur when sensibility and pain are
  absent, we cannot fail to appreciate its value. For example, a paralytic
  in taking a foot-bath, forgets to test its temperature, and putting his
  limbs into water while it is too hot, is severely scalded without knowing
  it.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>11.</b> The case of the traveller? Grain of sand? The sun and child?</div>
  <p><b>11.</b> A traveller, overcome by cold and fatigue, lies down and
  falls asleep near a large fire, and when he is aroused in the morning, it
  is discovered that one of his feet has been insensibly destroyed. A grain
  of sand, lodging in an insensitive eye, may cause inflammation and even
  the loss of sight. If intense light were not painful to the eye, many a
  child would innocently gaze upon the glories of the sun to the ruin of
  his sight.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>12.</b> Mission of pain? Painful impressions compared with those of pleasure?</div>
  <p><b>12.</b> Pain is, indeed, a present evil, but its relations with the
  future prove its mission merciful. Painful impressions cannot be
  recollected from past experience; and they cannot be called into
  existence by the fancy. Considered in the light of results, pain has a
  use above that of pleasure; for while the immoderate pursuit of the
  latter leads to harm, the tendency of pain is to restrict the hurtful
  courses of life, and in this manner to protect the body.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>13.</b> What does Magendie say of the relation of pain to pleasure?</div>
  <p><b>13.</b> The relations of pain to pleasure are thus described by the
  eminent physiologist, Magendie:&mdash;"By these sensations Nature induces
  us to concur in the order which she has established among organized
  beings. Though it may appear like sophistry to say that pain is the
  shadow of pleasure, yet it is certain that those who have exhausted the
  ordinary sources of pleasure have recourse to the <!-- Page 182 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page182"></a>{182}</span>causes of pain, and
  gratify themselves by their effects. Do we not see in all large cities,
  that men who are debauched and depraved find agreeable sensations, where
  others experience only intolerable pain?"</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>14.</b> The law of Nature as regards painful sensations among animals?</div>
  <p><b>14.</b> As to painful sensation among the inferior animals, the
  plan of Nature seems to be, that the higher the intelligence of the
  creature, and the more complete its power of defence, the more acute is
  its sensibility. We infer, therefore, that animals low in the scale of
  existence, and helpless, are not very liable to suffer pain.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>15.</b> The sensation of contact and pain? Special sensations of man? How regarded?</div>
  <p><b>15. Special Sensation.</b>&mdash;The sensations of simple contact
  and pain are felt by nearly all parts of the system, whether external or
  internal, and are the necessary consequence of the general sensibility;
  but, so far as the objects which surround us are concerned, these
  impressions are vague and passive in character, and inform the mind of
  none of the properties or powers of these objects. Besides these
  feelings, therefore, man is endowed with certain special sensations,
  which are positive and distinct in character, and which he can call into
  exercise at will, and employ in the pursuit of knowledge. For reasons
  relating to the original constitution of the body, these sensations are
  to be regarded as modifications of the general sensibility already
  alluded to, constructed with special reference to the different forces of
  Nature, of which we have any knowledge, such as heat, motion, gravity,
  sunlight, and the like.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>16.</b> What are the special senses? Special organs for them?</div>
  <p><b>16.</b> These distinct and active faculties are termed the special
  senses, and are five in number, viz., Touch, Taste, Smell, Sight, and
  Hearing. For the exercise of these senses, special organs are furnished,
  such as the hand, the tongue, the nose, the eye, and the ear. The manner
  in which the nerves of special sense terminate, varies in the <!-- Page
  183 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183"></a>{183}</span>case of
  each organ, so that each is adapted to one set of sensations alone, and
  is incapable of perceiving any other. Thus the nerve of hearing is
  excited by the undulations of sound, and not by those of light, while the
  reverse is true of the nerve of sight; and the nerve of smell can
  appreciate neither of them, being capable only of taking cognizance of
  the odorous properties of bodies.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>17.</b> What is said in relation to one more than the five senses?</div>
  <p><b>17.</b> By some writers six senses are accorded to man; the
  additional one being either the sense of temperature, for as we shall
  presently see this is not the same as touch; or according to others, the
  muscular sense by which we are enabled to estimate the weights of bodies.
  The latter also differs in some respects from the sense of touch.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>18.</b> The sense of touch, how prevalent? What is said of the hand?</div>
  <p><b>18. Organs of Touch.</b>&mdash;The sense of touch is possessed by
  nearly all portions of the general surface of the body, but it finds its
  highest development in the hands. The human hand is properly regarded as
  the model organ of touch. The minute structure of the skin fits it
  admirably for this form of sensation: the cuticle, or scarf-skin, is fine
  and flexible, while the cutis, or true skin, contains multitudes of
  nerve-filaments, arranged in rows of <i>papillæ</i>, or cone-like
  projections, about one-hundredth of an inch in length. It is estimated
  that there are 20,000 of these papillæ in a square inch of the palmar
  surface of the hand. Now, although the nerves of the cutis are the
  instruments by which impressions are received and transmitted to the
  brain, yet the cuticle is essential to the sensation of touch. This is
  shown by the fact that whenever the true skin is laid bare, as by a burn
  or blister, the only feeling that it experiences from contact is one of
  pain, not that of touch.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>19.</b> Office of the cuticle? Tips of the fingers? The fingers with thumb?</div>
  <p><b>19.</b> The office of the cuticle is thus made evident: it is to
  shield the nerve filaments from direct contact with <!-- Page 184
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>{184}</span>external
  objects. At the tips of the fingers, where touch is most delicate, the
  skin rests upon a cushion of elastic material, and receives firmness and
  permanence of shape by means of the nail placed upon the less sensitive
  side. Besides these favorable conditions, the form of the arm is such,
  and its motions are so easy and varied, that we are able to apply the
  test of touch in a great number of directions. The slender, tapering
  fingers, with their pliant joints, together with the strong opposable
  thumb, enable the hand to mold itself upon and grasp a great variety of
  objects; so that great as are the delicacy and grace of the hand, it is
  not wanting in the elements of power.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>20.</b> What special importance is attributed to the hand?</div>
  <p><b>20.</b> Its beauty and adaptation to the wants of man have made the
  hand an attractive theme for philosophers. They do not, however, always
  agree in their conclusions. One has the opinion that man has acquired his
  intelligence and achieved his place as "lord of creation," because he has
  this organ. Buffon, in effect, declares that with fingers twice as
  numerous and twice as long, we would become proportionally wiser; but
  Galen long ago took a more reasonable view, when he taught that "man is
  the wisest of animals, not because he possesses the hand; but because he
  is the wisest and understands its use, the hand has been given to him;
  for his mind, not his hand has taught him the arts." Another has well
  said, that "no one can study carefully the human hand and fail to be
  convinced of the existence of the Deity."</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>21.</b> The simplicity of touch? What does it teach us?</div>
  <p><b>21. The Sense of Touch.</b>&mdash;Touch is the simplest of the
  senses. It is that which the child first calls into exercise in solving
  the early problems of existence; and it is that which is in the most
  constant use throughout life. We are brought by the touch into the most
  intimate relations with external objects, and by it we learn the greater
  number, if not the most important, of the properties of <!-- Page 185
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>{185}</span>these objects;
  such as size, figure, solidity, motion, and smoothness or roughness of
  surface.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>22.</b> Importance of the sense of touch to the development of the other senses?</div>
  <p><b>22.</b> The sense of touch assists the other senses, especially
  that of sight, giving foundation and reality to their perceptions.
  Without it, the impressions received by the eye would be as vague and
  unreal as the figures that float through our dreams. A boy who had been
  blind from birth, at the age of twelve years received sight by means of a
  surgical operation: at first, he was unable to distinguish between a
  globe and a circular card, of the same color, before he had touched them.
  After that, he at once recognized the difference in their form. He knew
  the peculiarities of a dog and a cat by feeling, but not by sight, until
  one day, happening to take up the cat, he recognized the connection of
  the two sorts of impressions, those of touch and sight; and then, putting
  the cat down, he said: "So, puss, I shall know you next time."</p>

      alt="Fig. 45.--Sense of touch." title="Fig. 45.--Sense of touch." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 45.</span>
  </div>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>23.</b> Liability of touch to err? Describe the illustration.</div>
  <p><b>23.</b> Touch is considered the least liable to error of all the
  senses; yet, if that part of the skin by which the sense is exercised is
  removed from its customary position, a false impression may be created in
  the mind. This is well illustrated by an experiment, which dates from the
  time of Aristotle. If we cross the middle finger behind the <!-- Page 186
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page186"></a>{186}</span>forefinger,
  and then roll a marble, or some small object, upon the tips of the
  fingers (see Fig. 45), the impression will be that two marbles are felt.
  If the fingers, thus transposed, be applied to the end of the tongue, two
  tongues will be felt. When the nose is accidentally destroyed, the
  surgeon sometimes performs an operation for the purpose of forming a new
  one, by transplanting a partially removed piece of the skin of the
  forehead upon the injured part: then, if the new nose be touched or
  pinched, the feeling is referred to the forehead. This fact illustrates
  one important truth, that the nerves will re-unite after they have been
  cut, and feeling will be restored: if it were otherwise, a succession of
  slight cuts upon the fingers would seriously impair their tactile
  sensibility.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>24.</b> The delicacy of touch? Experiments with a pair of compasses?</div>
  <p><b>24. The Delicacy of Touch.</b>&mdash;Although the hand is the
  proper organ of this sense, yet it is exercised by various parts of the
  body, their degree of sensibility being proportional to the number of
  papillæ they contain. The varying degrees of tactile delicacy of the
  different parts of the surface have been measured, in an ingenious
  manner, by means of a pair of compasses, tipped with small pieces of
  cork. The two points of the compasses are touched at the same moment to
  the skin, the eyes being closed, and it is found that, in sensitive
  parts, the distance between the points may be quite slight, and yet each
  be plainly felt; while, in less sensitive parts, the points of the
  compasses are felt as a single point, although they are separated one or
  two inches.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>25.</b> Further experiments and results?</div>
  <p><b>25.</b> At the tips of the fingers, the distance between the points
  being one-twentieth of an inch, a double impression is felt. The distance
  must be twice as great, for the palm; four times as great, for the lips;
  and, on the forehead, it must be twenty times greater. At the middle of
  the back, where the touch is least acute, the points must be <!-- Page
  187 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>{187}</span>separated
  more than two inches before they can be separately felt. Therefore, the
  sense of touch in the fingers is said to be fifty times more delicate
  than upon the posterior surface of the body.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>26.</b> Exquisite delicacy of touch? The same among the blind?</div>
  <p><b>26.</b> Exquisite delicacy of touch is attained by practice. This
  is shown in many of the lighter and more graceful employments of daily
  life. Without it, the skill of the painter, sculptor, and musician would
  be rude indeed. By training, also, the physician acquires the <i>tactus
  eruditus</i>, or discriminating touch; but among the blind, delicacy of
  touch is most remarkable, and it here finds its highest value; for its
  possession, in a measure, compensates the loss of sight by enabling them
  to read, by means of raised letters, to work with certain tools, and even
  to play upon musical instruments. A person born without sight, and
  without hearing or voice, may, by the education of the touch, be rescued
  from apparent imbecility, and be taught not only to read and write, but
  even to perform household and other useful labors.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>27.</b> Rival candidates for the sixth sense? Give the two reasons on the subject.</div>
  <p><b>27. Sensations of Temperature and Weight.</b>&mdash;Each of these
  sensations has been described by the physiologists as a special sense,
  and they are rival candidates, so to speak, for the position and title of
  the sixth sense. In the sensation of temperature, or the thermal sense,
  touch bears a part, but the two feelings appear to be distinct. In proof
  of this, we observe, firstly, that they are not alike intense in the same
  situations; as, for example, the skin of the face and elbow, where the
  sense of touch is feeble, is very sensitive to impressions of heat and
  cold. Secondly, the ability to recognize temperature may be lost by
  paralysis, while the sensibility of touch remains unaffected. When the
  skin comes in contact with a very hot substance, the sensation felt is
  that of pain, not of touch. In like manner, a <!-- Page 188 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page188"></a>{188}</span>very cold substance
  causes pain, not the feeling of cold. So that a red-hot iron, and solid
  carbonic acid (the temperature of which is 108° below zero), feel alike;
  and each, if pressed slightly, will produce a blister.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>28.</b> The muscular sense? State what is said to illustrate the subject.</div>
  <p><b>28.</b> The <i>muscular sense</i>, by some considered distinct from
  touch, gives rise to the sensations of weight, and other forms of
  external resistance. That this feeling exists, is shown by the following
  simple experiment. If the hand be placed flat upon a table, and a
  somewhat heavy weight be put into it, touch alone is exercised and a
  feeling of pressure results; but if the hand be raised, a certain amount
  of muscular effort must be put forth, and thus the sensation of weight is
  recognized. Through the muscular sense, precision of effort is rendered
  possible; for by it we learn to adjust the force exerted to the weight of
  the object to be lifted, moved, or carried. Without it, all our movements
  would necessarily become ill-regulated and spasmodic. In cases of
  disease, where the sensibility of the lower limbs is lost, while power of
  motion remains, the patient is able to stand erect so long as he can see
  his limbs; but just as soon as his eyes are closed, he begins to waver,
  and will fall unless supported.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>29.</b> The organ of taste? The tongue? Its powers of motion?</div>
  <p><b>29. The Organ of Taste.</b>&mdash;The <i>tongue</i> is the special
  organ of the sense of taste; but the back part of the mouth also
  possesses this faculty. The tongue is a muscular organ, the muscles
  composing it being so numerous and interwoven as to give it the freedom
  and variety of motion which it possesses. It can curve itself upward or
  downward; it can extend or contract itself; and, with its point, can
  sweep the cavity of the mouth, in all directions, in the search for
  scattered particles of food.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>30.</b> Peculiarities of the tongue? Uses of the papillæ?</div>
  <p><b>30.</b> The upper surface of the tongue is peculiar, being marked

  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189"></a>{189}</span>which are of
  microscopic size, resembling those that abound in the fingers, and in
  other parts of the body that have the sense of touch. Others are much
  larger, and give to the tongue its roughness of feeling and appearance.
  Through the medium of these papillæ, the tongue receives impressions of
  touch and temperature, as well as taste: indeed, its extremity is fully
  as delicate, in respect to tactile sensations, as the tips of the fingers
  themselves. It can recognize the two points of the compasses when
  separated not more than one-twenty-fourth of an inch; the back of it is
  much less sensitive to touch, while at the same time it is more highly
  sensitive to impressions of taste.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>31.</b> Resemblance to the parts of the tongue? Powers and functions of the parts?</div>
  <p><b>31.</b> Each lateral half of the tongue resembles the other in
  structure, and each receives the same number of nerves&mdash;three. One
  of these regulates motion, the other two are nerves of special sense. One
  of the latter supplies the front half of the tongue, and is called the
  <i>gustatory</i> nerve. This is a branch of the great cranial nerve,
  called the "fifth pair," which ramifies in all parts of the face. The
  back of the tongue is endowed with the power of taste through a nerve
  known as the <i>glosso-pharyngeal</i>, because it is distributed both to
  the tongue and throat. This difference in the nervous supply of the
  tongue becomes significant, when we learn, as we shall presently, that
  each part of it perceives a different class of flavors.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>32.</b> Taste? What are the requisites to taste?</div>
  <p><b>32. The Sense of Taste.</b>&mdash;Taste is the special sense by
  means of which we discover the savors, or flavoring properties of the
  substances, which come in contact with the tongue. Mere contact with the
  surface of the tongue, however, is not sufficient, but contact with the
  extremities of the nerves of taste within the papillæ is required. In
  order that the substance to be tasted may penetrate the <!-- Page 190
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"></a>{190}</span>cells covering
  the nerves, it must either be liquid in form, or readily soluble in the
  watery secretion of the mouth, the saliva. The tongue must be moist also.
  If the substance be insoluble, as glass or sand, or the tongue dry, the
  sense of taste is not awakened. In sickness, when the tongue is heavily
  coated, the taste is very defective, or, as is frequently expressed,
  "nothing tastes aright."</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>33.</b> Portions of the tongue endowed with taste? Where else does the sense lodge? What is stated in respect to sweet and bitter flavors? Reflex effects mentioned?</div>
  <p><b>33.</b> All portions of the tongue are not alike endowed with the
  sense of taste, that function being limited to the posterior third, and
  to the margin and tip of this organ. The soft palate, also, possesses the
  sense of taste; hence, an article that has an agreeable flavor may very
  properly be spoken of as palatable, as is often done. All parts of the
  tongue do not perceive equally well the same flavors. Thus, the front
  extremity and margin, which is the portion supplied by the "fifth pair"
  of nerves, perceives more acutely sweet and sour tastes; but the base of
  the tongue, supplied by the <i>glosso-pharyngeal</i> nerve, is especially
  sensitive to salt and bitter substances. The nerve of the front part of
  the tongue, as before stated, is in active sympathy with those of the
  face, while the relations of the other nerve are chiefly with the throat
  and stomach; so that when an intensely sour taste is perceived, the
  countenance is involuntarily distorted, and is said to wear an acid
  expression. On the other hand, a very bitter taste affects certain
  internal organs, and occasions a sensation of nausea, or sickness of the
  stomach.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>34.</b> What is stated of the relations of taste with other senses?</div>
  <p><b>34. Relations of Taste with other Senses.</b>&mdash;Taste is not a
  simple sense. Certain other sensations, as those of touch, temperature,
  smell, and pain, are blended and confused with it; and certain so-called
  tastes are really sensations of another kind. Thus an astringent taste,
  like that of alum, is more properly an astringent feeling, and <!-- Page
  191 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"></a>{191}</span>results
  from an impression made upon the nerves of touch, that ramify in the
  tongue. In like manner, the qualities known as smooth, oily, watery, and
  mealy tastes, are dependent upon these same nerves of touch. A burning or
  pungent taste is a sensation of pain, having its seat in the tongue and
  throat. A cooling taste, like that of mint, pertains to that modification
  of touch called the sense of temperature.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>35.</b> Its dependence on smell? on sight?</div>
  <p><b>35.</b> Taste is largely dependent upon the sense of smell. A
  considerable number of substances, like vanilla, coffee, and garlic,
  which appear to possess a strong and distinct flavor, have in reality a
  powerful odor, but only a feeble taste. When the sense of smell is
  interfered with by holding the nose, it becomes difficult to distinguish
  between substances of this class. The same effect is frequently observed
  when smell is blunted during an ordinary cold in the head. Sight also
  contributes to taste. With the eyes closed, food appears comparatively
  insipid; and a person smoking tobacco in the dark is unable to determine
  by the taste whether his cigar is lighted or not. Accordingly, it is not
  a bad plan to close the nose and shut the eyes when about to swallow some
  disagreeable medicine.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>36.</b> The chief use of the sense of taste? The position of its organs? The rule as regards wholesome and unwholesome food? Remarks respecting the rule?</div>
  <p><b>36. Influence of Education on the Taste.</b>&mdash;The chief use of
  the sense of taste appears to be to act as a guide in the selection of
  proper food. Hence its organs are properly placed at the entrance of the
  digestive canal. As a general rule, those articles which gratify the
  taste are wholesome; while the opposite is true of those which impress it
  disagreeably. This statement is more exact in reference to the early
  years of life than to later years, when, by reason of mischievous habits,
  the sense of taste has become dulled or perverted. The desires of a child
  are simple; he is fully satisfied with plain and wholesome articles of
  diet, and must usually "learn to like" those <!-- Page 192 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page192"></a>{192}</span>which have a strongly
  marked flavor. Accordingly, it is far easier at this age to encourage the
  preference for plain food, and thus establish healthful habits, than
  later in life to uproot habits of indulgence in stimulating substances,
  after their ill effects begin to manifest themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>37.</b> Diversity in tastes of men? How shown? The education of the sense of taste?</div>
  <p><b>37.</b> The tastes of men present the most singular diversities,
  partly the result of necessity and partly of habit or education. The
  Esquimaux like the rank smell of whale oil, which is a kind of food
  admirably suited to the requirements of their icy climate; and travellers
  who go from our climate to theirs are not slow to develop a liking for
  the same articles that the natives themselves enjoy. The sense of taste
  is rendered very acute by education, as is shown in an especial manner by
  those who become professional "tasters" of tea and wine.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>38.</b> Location of the sense of smell? The nose? "Roof of the mouth?"</div>
  <p><b>38. The Sense of Smell&mdash;the Nasal Cavities.</b>&mdash;The
  sense of smell is located in the delicate mucous membrane which lines the
  interior of the nose. That prominent feature of the face, the nose, which
  is merely the front boundary of the true nasal organ, is composed partly
  of bone and partly of cartilage. The upper part of it is united with the
  skull by means of a few small bones; to which circumstance is due its
  permanence of shape. The lower portion, or tip of the nose, contains
  several thin pieces of cartilage, which render it flexible and better
  able to resist the effects of blows and pressure. Behind the nose we find
  quite a spacious chamber, separated from the mouth by the hard palate,
  forming the "roof of the mouth," and by the soft palate (see Fig. 46);
  and divided into two cavities by a central partition running from before
  backward.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>39.</b> Cavities of the nose? Obstruction of the passage of air through them?</div>
  <p><b>39.</b> These nasal cavities, constituting the true beginning of
  the air-passages, extend from the nose backward to the <!-- Page 193
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page193"></a>{193}</span>upper opening
  of the throat, and rise as high as the junction of the nose with the
  forehead. The inner wall of each cavity is straight and smooth; but from
  the outer wall there jut into each cavity three small scroll-like bones.
  The structure of these bones is very light, and hence they have been
  called the "spongy" bones of the nose. In this manner, while the extent
  of surface is greatly increased by the formation of these winding
  passages, the cavities are rendered extremely narrow; so much so, in
  fact, that a moderate swelling of the mucous membrane which lines them,
  as from a cold, is sufficient to obstruct the passage of air through
  them.</p>

    Cavity.</span>
  </div>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>40.</b> The special nerve of smell? Its location?</div>
  <p><b>40. The Nerve of Smell.</b>&mdash;The internal surface of the nasal
  passages is covered by a delicate and sensitive mucous membrane. Its
  surface is quite extensive, following as it does, all the inequalities
  produced by the curved spongy bones of the nose. The upper portion of it
  alone is the seat of smell, since that part alone receives branches from
  the "first pair" of cranial nerves, or the olfactory nerve, which is the
  special nerve of smell (see Fig. 43). In Fig. 46 is shown the
  distribution of this nerve, in the form of an intricate network upon the
  two upper spongy bones. The nerve itself (1) does not issue from the
  skull, but rests upon a thin bone which separates it from the cavity of
  the nose; and the branches which proceed from it pass through this bone
  by means of numerous small openings. The <!-- Page 194 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page194"></a>{194}</span>engraving represents
  the outer surface of the right nasal cavity; the three wave-like
  inequalities, upon which the nervous network is spread out, are due to
  the spongy bones. The left cavity is supplied in the same manner.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>41.</b> Branches of the "fifth pair" of nerves? Nasal mucus? Birds?</div>
  <p><b>41.</b> The nerves which ramify over the lower part of the
  membrane, and which endow it with sensibility to touch and pain, are
  branches of the "fifth pair" of nerves. An irritation applied to the
  parts where this nerve is distributed occasions sneezing, that is, a
  spasmodic contraction of the diaphragm; the object of which is the
  expulsion of the irritating cause. The manner in which the olfactory
  nerve-fibres terminate is peculiar. Unlike the extremities of other
  nerves, which are covered in by a greater or less thickness of tissue,
  these come directly to the surface of the mucous membrane, and thus come
  into very close contact with the odorous particles that are carried along
  by the respired air. The surface is at all times kept in a moist
  condition by an abundant flow of nasal mucus; otherwise it would become
  dry, hard, and insensitive from the continual passage of air to and fro
  in breathing. Birds, which respire more actively than men, have a special
  gland, for secreting a lubricating fluid, located in the air-passages of
  the head.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>42.</b> Smell? Touch? Taste? Design of smell? Invisible and gaseous particles? The extreme fineness of the particles? Musk? In other cases?</div>
  <p><b>42. The Uses of the Sense of Smell.</b>&mdash;Smell is the special
  sense which enables us to appreciate odors. Touch, as we have seen, is
  largely concerned with solid bodies; and taste, with fluids, or with
  solids in solution. Smell, on the other hand, is designed to afford us
  information in reference to substances in a volatile or gaseous form.
  Invisible and subtile particles emanate from odorous bodies, and are
  brought by the respired air in contact with the terminal filaments of the
  olfactory nerve, upon which an agreeable or disagreeable impression is
  produced. <!-- Page 195 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page195"></a>{195}</span>The fineness of the particles that
  constitute odors is often so extreme, that they elude all attempts to
  measure or weigh them. A piece of musk, for instance, may be kept for
  several years, constantly emitting perfume, without any appreciable loss
  of weight. In other cases, a loss of substance is perceptible, such as
  the essential oils, which enter into the composition of the ordinary
  perfumes.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>43.</b> Aid given by smell? The highest use of the sense? Explain the manner.</div>
  <p><b>43.</b> Smell, like taste, aids us in the choice of proper food,
  leading us to reject such articles as have a rank or putrid odor, and
  which are, as a rule, unfit to be eaten. The highest usefulness of this
  sense, however, consists in the protection it affords to the organs of
  respiration. Stationed at the gateways of the air-passages, it examines
  the current of air as it enters, and warns us of the presence of noxious
  gases, and of other and generally invisible enemies to health. Not all
  dangerous vapors are offensive, but almost all offensive vapors are unfit
  to be breathed. A number of small stiff hairs grow from the margin of the
  nostrils to prevent the entrance of dust and other atmospheric
  impurities, which would be alike injurious to the olfactory mucous
  membrane and to the lungs. The benevolent design of the Maker of our
  bodies may be observed in all parts of their mechanism; but, probably, in
  none is it more clearly displayed than in connection with the sense of
  smell.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>44.</b> Sense of smell in the inferior animals? How, and in what cases, illustrated?</div>
  <p><b>44.</b> The sense of smell is developed in a remarkable degree in
  certain of the inferior animals, and is especially acute in reference to
  the peculiar emanations that appear to characterize the different
  animals. The lion and other carnivorous beasts scent their prey from a
  great distance; and the fox-hound is able to track the fox through
  thickets and over open country for many miles; while the timid, helpless
  herbivora, such as the deer and sheep, find in the <!-- Page 196 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page196"></a>{196}</span>sense of smell a means
  of protection against their natural enemies, of whose approach they are
  in this manner warned. By training this sense in the dog, and making it
  subservient to his use, man is able to hunt with success certain shy and
  very fleet animals, which otherwise he could but seldom approach. Among
  men, individuals differ greatly in respect to the development of this
  sense; and especially in certain savage tribes it is found to be
  extremely delicate. Humboldt states that the natives of Peru can, by this
  sense, distinguish in the dark between persons of different races.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>45.</b> What is sight? What information does it furnish? Composite visual sensations?</div>
  <p><b>45. The Sense of Sight.</b>&mdash;Sight, or Vision, is the special
  sense by means of which we appreciate the color, form, size, distance,
  and other physical properties of the objects of external nature.
  Primarily, this sense furnishes us with information concerning the
  different shades of color and the different degrees of brightness: these
  are the simple sensations of sight, such as the yellowness and glitter of
  a gold coin. In addition to these, there are composite visual sensations,
  produced by the joint action of the other senses and by the use of the
  memory and judgment; such as, in the case of the coin, its roundness,
  solidity, size, its distance and direction from us. So that many of our
  sensations, commonly considered as due to sight, are in reality the
  results of intellectual processes which take place instantaneously and
  unconsciously.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>46.</b> Comparison between sight and hearing? Relative capacity of deaf and blind?</div>
  <p><b>46.</b> This faculty not only has value in the practical every-day
  affairs of life, but it contributes so largely to the culture of the
  intellect and to our higher forms of pleasure, that some writers are
  disposed to rate it as the first and most valuable of the senses. Others,
  however, maintain that the sense of hearing does not yield in importance
  to that of sight; and they cite in support of their position <!-- Page
  197 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"></a>{197}</span>the fact
  that the blind are commonly cheerful and gay, while the deaf are inclined
  to be morose and melancholy. In respect to the relative capacity for
  receiving education in the deaf and blind, it is found that the former
  learn more quickly, but their attainments are not profound; while the
  blind acquire more slowly, but are able to study more thoroughly.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>47.</b> Sight, unlike the other senses? In the case of the stars?</div>
  <p><b>47. Light.&mdash;The Optic Nerve.</b>&mdash;Unlike the senses
  previously considered&mdash;touch, taste, and smell&mdash;sight does not
  bring us into immediate contact with the bodies that are examined; but,
  by it, we perceive the existence and qualities of objects that are at a
  greater or less distance from us. In the case of the stars, the distance
  is incalculable, while the book we read is removed but a few inches.
  Light is the agent which gives to this sense its wide range. The nature
  of this mysterious force is not known, and it is not here to be
  discussed; since its study belongs more properly to the province of
  natural philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>48.</b> The undulatory theory of light? What does the theory suppose?</div>
  <p><b>48.</b> It is sufficient, in this connection, to state that the
  theory of light now generally accepted, and which best explains the facts
  of optics, is that known as the undulatory theory. This theory supposes
  that there exists an intangible, elastic medium, which fills all space,
  and penetrates all transparent substances, and which is thrown into
  exceedingly rapid undulations or waves, by the sun and every other
  luminous body; the undulations being propagated with extreme rapidity,
  and moving not less than 186,000 miles in a second.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>49.</b> The sensation of light? Optic nerve?</div>
  <p><b>49.</b> These waves are thought to produce in the eye the sensation
  of light, in the same manner as the sonorous vibrations of the air
  produce in the ear the sensation of sound. That part of the eye which is
  sensitive to these waves is the expansion of the <i>optic nerve</i>. It
  is sensitive <!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page198"></a>{198}</span>to no other impression than that of light,
  and it is the only nerve which is acted upon by this agent. The optic
  nerve, also called the "second pair" of cranial nerves, is the means of
  communication between the eye and the brain.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>50.</b> The two nerves constituting the pair of nerves?</div>
  <p><b>50.</b> The two nerves constituting the pair, arise from ganglia
  lying at the base of the cerebrum, one of them on each side; from which
  points they advance to the eyes, being united together in the middle of
  their course in the form of the letter X (Fig. 43&mdash;2). By this union
  the two eyes are enabled to act harmoniously, and in some respects to
  serve as a double organ. And by reason of this same intimate nervous
  communication, when serious disease affects one eye, the fellow-eye is
  extremely liable to become the seat of <i>sympathetic</i> inflammation;
  and this, if neglected, almost certainly results in hopeless
  blindness.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>51.</b> Why is the eye called the "window of the soul?" Why, the subject of enthusiastic study?</div>
  <p><b>51. The Organ of Sight.&mdash;The Eye.</b>&mdash;The proximity of
  the eye to the brain, and the important part it performs in giving
  expression to the emotions, have given it the name of "the window of the
  soul." The exceeding beauty of its external parts, and the high value of
  its function, have long made this organ the subject of enthusiastic
  study. It is chiefly within the last twenty years, however, that this
  study has been successful and fruitful of practical results. Several
  ingenious instruments have been invented for the examination of the eye
  in health and disease, and new operations have been devised for the
  relief of blindness and of impaired vision. As a result, it is now a
  well-marked fact that, in civilized lands, the number of those who suffer
  from loss of sight is proportionally much less than in countries where
  science is less known and cultivated.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>52.</b> The most obvious fact? The consequence? The next thing noticed? Its range of view? Of what does the organ of vision consist?</div>
  <p><b>52.</b> The most obvious fact in respect to the apparatus of <!--
  Page 199 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199"></a>{199}</span>sight
  is that there are two eyes, which may either act together as one, and be
  fixed upon one object, or one eye may be used independently of the other.
  In consequence of this arrangement the loss of one eye does not
  necessitate blindness, and, in fact, it not infrequently happens that the
  sight of one eye may be long impaired or lost before the fact is
  discovered. We next notice that it is placed at the most elevated part of
  the body, in front, and near the brain. It also commands a wide range of
  view, being itself moved with great rapidity, and being further aided by
  the free motion of the head and neck. The organ of vision consists
  essentially of two parts: the optical instrument itself&mdash;the
  eyeball&mdash;and its enveloping parts, or the case in which the
  instrument is kept free from harm. The latter, which are external, and
  which we shall first consider, are chiefly the <i>Orbits</i>, the
  <i>Eyelids</i>, and the apparatus for the <i>Tears</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>53.</b> The protection of the eyeball against injury? The overhanging brow? The opening for the optic nerve?</div>
  <p><b>53. The Orbits.</b>&mdash;The eyeball, which is a delicate organ,
  is well defended against external injury within the orbits or bony
  sockets of the head. These are deep conical hollows, bounded in part by
  the bones of the skull, and in part by those of the nose and cheek. The
  orbit juts out beyond the most exposed portion of the eyeball, as may be
  seen by laying a book over the eye, when it will be found that no part of
  the eyeball, unless it be very prominent, will be touched by the book; so
  that the only direction in which an injury is liable to be received is
  immediately in front of the eye. The overhanging brow is itself covered
  by a layer of thick skin, studded with short, stout hairs, which are so
  bent as to prevent the perspiration from running into the eye and
  obscuring vision. Through a hole in the bottom of the orbit, the nerve of
  sight passes outward from the brain. The orbit also contains a <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'considera-ale' on line break."
  >considerable</span> amount of a fatty tissue, upon which, as upon an

<div class="sidenotee"><b>54.</b> What are the eyelids? The upper lid? The lower one? The mucous membrane of the eye?</div>
  <p><b>54. The Eyelids.</b>&mdash;The eyelids are two movable curtains, or
  folds, which, when shut, cover the front part of the orbit, and hide the
  eye from view. The upper lid is the larger, has a curved margin, and
  moves freely, while the lower lid is comparatively short and straight,
  and has but a slight degree of motion (Fig. 47). Skin covers the exterior
  of the lids, while a fine mucous membrane lines their inner surface, and
  is likewise spread out over the entire front of the eyeball. This
  membrane, which is called the <i>Conjunctiva</i>, is highly sensitive,
  and thus plays an important part in protecting the eye against the
  lodgment of sand, ashes, chaff, and other foreign particles that are
  blown about in the air. This sensitive membrane will not endure the
  presence of these particles. If any find access, it causes a constant
  winking, a flow of tears, and other signs of irritation, until it is
  removed.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>55.</b> The eyelashes? The little points within the line of the lashes? Of what use are these glands?</div>
  <p><b>55.</b> The long, silky eyelashes, which garnish the edges of the
  lids, act like a sieve to prevent the entry of dust and the like; and
  together with the lids, they regulate the amount of light which is
  permitted to enter the eye, so that it is shielded from a sudden flood or
  glare of light. The little points seen in the figure just within the line
  of the lashes, especially on the lower lid, represent the mouths of
  numerous little sebaceous glands (Fig. 48, <span
  class="scac">D,D</span>), such as are always <!-- Page 201 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page201"></a>{201}</span>found in the
  neighborhood of hairs. These glands supply a thick, oily material which
  greases the edges of the lids and prevents their adhering together, and
  likewise prevents the overflow of the tears upon the cheek.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>56.</b> The location of the lachrymal gland? The use of the gland?</div>
  <p><b>56. The Lachrymal Fluid, or the Tears.</b>&mdash;Just within the
  outer part of the bony arch of the brow, where the bone may be felt to be
  sharper than in other positions, is lodged a little organ called the
  lachrymal gland, the situation of which is indicated in Fig. 47, 1. This
  is the gland whence flows the watery secretion, commonly called the
  <i>tears</i>, which is designed to perform an exceedingly important duty
  in lubricating the lids, and in keeping the exposed surface of the
  eyeball moist and transparent. For, without this or some similar liquid,
  the front of the eye would speedily become dry and lustreless, like that
  of a fish which has been removed from the water: the simple exposure of
  the eye to the air would then suffice to destroy vision.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>57.</b> When does the secretion of the tears occur? The secretion not used for the eye? Location of the nasal duct? Its use? The overflow of tears in old people?</div>
  <p><b>57.</b> This secretion of the tears takes place at all times,
  during the night as well as the day; but it is seldom noticed, except
  when under the influence of some strong mental emotion, whether of sorrow
  or happiness, it is poured forth in excess, so as to overflow the lids.
  Strong light or a rapid breeze will, among many other causes, excite the
  flow of the tears. That portion of this secretion which is not used in
  moistening the eye is carried off into the nose by a canal situated near
  the inner angle of the eye, called the <i>nasal duct</i>. This duct is
  shown in Fig. 47, 2, and is connected with each lid by delicate tubes,
  which are indicated by dotted lines in the figure; the asterisk marks the
  little opening in the lower lid, by which the tears enter the nasal duct.
  By gently turning the inner part of that lid downward, and looking in a
  mirror, <!-- Page 202 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page202"></a>{202}</span>this small "lachrymal point" may be seen
  in your own eye. In old people, these points become everted, and do not
  conduct the tears to the nasal cavity, so that they are inconvenienced by

<div class="sidenotee"><b>58.</b> The watery fluid passing over the eyeball? Design of the arrangement? Winking?</div>
  <p><b>58.</b> Thus we observe that the gland which forms the tears is
  placed at the outer part of the eye, while their means of exit is at the
  inner angle of the eye; which fact renders it necessary that this watery
  fluid shall pass over the surface of the eyeball before it can escape.
  This arrangement cannot be accidental, but evinces design, for it thus
  secures the perfect lubrication of the surface of the eye, and cleanses
  it from the smaller particles of dust <!-- Page 203 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page203"></a>{203}</span>which may enter it, in
  spite of the vigilance of the lids and lashes. The act of winking, which
  is generally unconsciously performed, and which takes place six or more
  times in a minute, assists this passage of the tears across the eye, and
  is especially frequent when the secretion is most abundant.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>59.</b> Describe the shape of the eyeball. Its structure.</div>
  <p><b>59. The Eyeball.</b>&mdash;The remarkable optical instrument called
  the eyeball, or the globe of the eye, upon which sight depends, is, as
  the name indicates, spherical in shape. It is not a perfect sphere, since
  the front part projects somewhat beyond the rest, and at the posterior
  part the optic nerve (Fig. 48, <span class="scac">N</span>) is united to
  it, resembling the junction of the stem with a fruit. In its long
  diameter, that is, the horizontal or from side to side, it measures a
  little more than an inch; in other directions it is rather less than an
  inch. In structure, the ball of the eye is firm, and its tense round
  contour may in part be felt by pressing the fingers over the closed
  lids.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>60.</b> Of what is the eyeball composed? State how.</div>
  <p><b>60.</b> The eyeball is composed chiefly of three internal,
  transparent media, called <i>humors</i>; and three investing coats, or
  <i>tunics</i>. The former are the <i>aqueous humor</i>, Fig. 48, <span
  class="scac">A</span>, the <i>crystalline lens</i> <span
  class="scac">L</span>, and the <i>vitreous humor</i> <span
  class="scac">V</span>. Of these the lens alone is solid. The three coats
  of the eyeball are called the <i>sclerotic</i> <span
  class="scac">S</span>, the <i>choroid</i> <span class="scac">CH</span>,
  and the <i>retina</i> <span class="scac">R</span>. This arrangement
  exists in respect to five-sixths of the globe of the eye, but in the
  anterior one-sixth, these coats are replaced by the <i>cornea</i> <span
  class="scac">C</span>, which is thin and transparent, so that the rays of
  light pass freely through it, as through a clear window-pane.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>61.</b> The shape of the cornea? Its structure? The "white of the eye?"</div>
  <p><b>61.</b> In shape, the cornea is circular and prominent, resembling
  a miniature watch-glass, about 1/25 of an inch thick. In structure, it
  resembles horn (as the name signifies), or the nail of the finger, and is
  destitute of <!-- Page 204 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page204"></a>{204}</span>blood-vessels. The <i>Sclerotic</i> (from
  <i>scleros</i>, hard) is composed of dense, white fibrous tissue, and
  gives to the eyeball its firmness of figure and its white color; in
  front, it constitutes the part commonly called "the white of the eye." It
  is one of the strongest tissues in the body; it possesses very few
  vessels, and is not very sensitive. It affords protection to the
  extremely delicate interior parts of the eye; and the little muscles
  which effect its movements are inserted into the sclerotic a short
  distance behind the cornea (see Fig. 48, <span class="scac">Y</span>,
  <span class="scac">Z</span>). It is perforated posteriorly to admit the
  optic nerve.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>62.</b> The second or middle coat of the eyeball? Its dark color?</div>
  <p><b>62.</b> The <i>Choroid</i> is the second or middle coat of the
  eyeball, and lies closely attached to the inner surface of the sclerotic.
  Unlike the latter tunic, its structure is soft and tender, it is dark in
  color, and possesses a great abundance of blood-vessels. Its dark color
  is due to a layer of dark brown or chocolate-colored cells spread out
  over its inner surface. This dark layer serves to absorb the rays of
  light after they have traversed the transparent structures in front of
  it; if the rays were reflected from side to side within the eye, instead
  of being thus absorbed, confused vision would result from the multitude
  of images which would be impressed upon the optic nerve.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>63.</b> Similar mechanism in microscopes? The albinos? White rabbits?</div>
  <p><b>63.</b> This mechanism has been unconsciously imitated by the
  opticians, who, when they make a microscope or telescope, take care that
  the interior of its tube shall be coated with a thick layer of black
  paint or lamp-black; for without it, a clear delineation of the object to
  be viewed is impossible. The albinos, in whom these dark cells of the
  choroid are wanting, have imperfect vision, especially in the daytime and
  in strong lights. The dark cells are also wanting in white rabbits, and
  other animals that have red or pink eyes; their vision appears to be
  imperfect in the presence of a bright light. <!-- Page 205 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page205"></a>{205}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>64.</b> What is the iris? Its construction? How is the size of the pupil regulated?</div>
  <p><b>64. The Iris.</b>&mdash;Continuous with the choroid, in the front
  part of the globe of the eye, is a thin, circular curtain, which
  occasions the brown, blue, or gray color of the eye in different
  individuals. On account of the varieties of its color, this membrane has
  received the name <i>Iris</i>, which is the Greek word for "rainbow" (see
  Fig. 48, <span class="scac">I</span>). A front view of it is shown in
  Fig. 47. The iris is pierced in its centre by a round opening, called the
  <i>pupil</i> (<span class="scac">P</span>), which is constantly varying
  in size. In olden times it was spoken of as the "apple of the eye." The
  hinder surface of the iris, except in albinos, has a layer of dark
  coloring matter resembling that of the choroid. The iris is a muscular
  organ, and contains two distinct sets of fibres; one of which is
  circular, while the other radiates outward from the pupil. The action of
  these sets of fibres regulates the size of the pupil; for when the
  circular set acts, the pupil contracts, and when the other set acts, the
  opening expands. Their action is involuntary, and depends on the reflex
  system of nerves, which causes the contraction of the pupil when a strong
  light falls upon the eye, and its expansion when the illumination is
  feeble.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>65.</b> The admission of light to the eye? The action of the iris under different circumstances? The lustre of the eye, how affected in youth and old age?</div>
  <p><b>65.</b> The iris, accordingly, serves a very useful purpose in
  regulating the admission of light to the eye. It, however, does not act
  instantaneously; and hence, when we pass quickly from a dark room into
  the bright sunlight, the vision is at first confused by the glare of
  light, but as soon as the pupil contracts, the ability to see becomes
  perfect. On the other hand, when we enter a dark apartment, such as a
  cellar, for a short time we can see nothing clearly; but as soon as the
  pupil expands and admits more light, we are enabled to distinguish the
  surrounding objects. Animals of the cat species, and others which prowl
  around after nightfall, are enabled to see in the dark by <!-- Page 206
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206"></a>{206}</span>having the
  iris very dilatable. The size of the pupil affects the lustre of the eye.
  When it is large, as it usually is during youth, the eye appears clear
  and brilliant; while in old age the pupil is small and the eye is dull.
  The brilliancy of the eye is in part, at least, dependent upon the
  reflection of light from the front surface of the crystalline lens.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>66.</b> Means used to increase the beauty of the eye? The injurious consequences?</div>
  <p><b>66.</b> Certain poisonous vegetables have the property of causing
  the pupil to dilate, and have been used in small doses to increase the
  beauty of the eye. One of these drugs has been so largely used by the
  ladies for this purpose, that it has received the name <i>belladonna</i>,
  from the Italian words meaning "beautiful lady." This hazardous practice
  has resulted more than once in the death of the person desiring thus to
  increase her personal attraction. The common English name for belladonna
  is "deadly nightshade." (In the diagram on page <a
  href="#page214">214</a> the shape and relations of the iris are more
  accurately shown than in the figure referred to above.)</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>67.</b> What part does the retina constitute? How formed? Its texture? Color? Sensitiveness?</div>
  <p><b>67. The Retina</b> constitutes the third and inner coat of the
  globe of the eye. This, the important part of the eye that is sensitive
  to light, is a kind of nervous membrane, formed by the expansion of the
  ultimate filaments of the optic nerve. Its texture is soft, smooth, and
  very thin; it is translucent and of an opaline, or grayish-white color.
  It is sensitive to light alone; and if any form of mechanical irritation
  be applied to it, the sensations of touch and pain are not experienced,
  but flashes of fire, sparks, and other luminous appearances are
  perceived. Thus an electric shock given to the eye-ball occasions a flash
  of light; and a sudden fall, or a blow upon the eye, is often apparently
  accompanied by the vision of "stars."</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>68.</b> Specific energy of the optic nerve? Trial in Germany?</div>
  <p><b>68.</b> These phenomena are due to what is termed the <!-- Page 207
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page207"></a>{207}</span>"specific
  energy" of the optic nerve, which nerve, in common with the other nerves
  of special sense, obeys a general law of nature, which requires that,
  whenever one of these nerves is stimulated, it shall respond with the
  sensation peculiar to itself. These flashes of retinal light have no
  power to illuminate external objects, although the opposite of this
  statement has been maintained. On the occasion of a remarkable trial in
  Germany, it was claimed by a person who had been severely assaulted on a
  very dark night, that the flashes of light caused by repeated blows upon
  the head enabled him to see with sufficient distinctness to recognize his
  assailant. But the evidence of scientific men entirely refuted this
  claim, by pronouncing that the eye, under the circumstances named, was
  incapacitated for vision. Too intense light occasions a feeling of pain,
  but it is of a peculiar kind, and is termed "dazzling."</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 49.</span>
  </div>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>69.</b> Sensitiveness of all parts of the retina? Experiment to prove the existence of the "blind spot."</div>
  <p><b>69.</b> All parts of the retina are not equally sensitive, and
  singularly enough, the point of entry of the nerve of sight, in the back
  part of the eyeball, is entirely insensible to light, and is called the
  "blind spot." The existence of this point may be proven by a simple
  experiment. Hold the accompanying figure, on page 207, directly in front
  of and parallel with the eyes. Close the left eye, and fix the sight
  steadily on the left-hand circle; then, by gradually varying the distance
  of the figure from the eye, at a certain distance (about six inches), the
  right-hand circle will disappear, <!-- Page 208 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page208"></a>{208}</span>but nearer or further
  than that, it will be plainly seen. The other eye may be also tried, with
  a similar result: if the gaze be directed to the right-hand circle, the
  left one will seem to disappear. The experiment may be repeated by using
  two black buttons on the marble top of a bureau, or on some other white
  surface. The blind spot does not practically interfere with vision, since
  the eye is seldom fixed immovably on an object, and the insensitive parts
  of the two eyes can never be directed upon the same object at the same
  time.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>70.</b> Duration of impressions upon the retina? How illustrated?</div>
  <p><b>70.</b> Impressions made upon the retina are not at once lost, but
  persist a measurable length of time, and then gradually fade away. Thus,
  a bright light or color, gazed at intently, cannot be immediately
  dismissed from sight by closing or turning away the eyes. A stick lighted
  at one end, if whirled around rapidly in the dark, presents the
  appearance of an unbroken luminous ring; and the spokes of a rapidly
  revolving carriage-wheel seem to be merged into a plane surface. If an
  object move too rapidly to produce this sort of lasting impression, it is
  invisible, as in the case of a cannon-ball passing through the air in
  front of us.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>71.</b> What further illustration? Winking, why it is not noticed. Ease with which the retina is fatigued or deprived of sensibility? How shown?</div>
  <p><b>71.</b> If a card, painted with two primary colors&mdash;as red and
  yellow&mdash;be made to rotate swiftly, the eye perceives neither of them
  distinctly; but the card appears painted with their secondary
  color&mdash;orange. The average duration of retinal images is estimated
  at one-eighth of a second; and it is because they thus endure, that the
  act of winking, which takes place so frequently, but so quickly, is not
  noticed and does not interrupt the vision. The retina is easily fatigued
  or deprived of its sensibility. After looking steadfastly at a bright
  light, or at a white object on a black ground, a dark spot, corresponding
  in shape to the bright object, <!-- Page 209 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page209"></a>{209}</span>presents itself in whatever direction we
  look. This spot passes away as the retina resumes its activity.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>72.</b> How further shown? How is the result accounted for? "Color-blindness?"</div>
  <p><b>72.</b> If a bright color be gazed at intently, and the eyes then
  be turned to a white surface, a spot will appear; but its color will be
  the complement of that of the object. Fix the eye upon a red wafer upon a
  white ground, and on removing the wafer a greenish spot of the same shape
  takes its place. This result happens because a certain portion of the
  retina has exhausted its power to perceive the red ray, and perceives
  only its complementary ray, which is green. The color thus substituted by
  the exhausted retina is called a physiological or accidental color. In
  some persons the retina is incapable of distinguishing different colors,
  when they are said to be affected with "color-blindness." Thus, red and
  green may appear alike, and then a cherry-tree, full of ripe fruit, will
  seem of the same color in every part. Railroad accidents have occurred
  because the engineer of the train, who was color-blind, has mistaken the
  color of a signal.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>73.</b> The location of the crystalline lens? How supported? Its color and texture? Shape? Size?</div>
  <p><b>73. The Crystalline Lens.</b>&mdash;Across the front of the eye,
  just behind the iris, is situated the <i>Crystalline lens</i>, enclosed
  within its own capsule. It is supported in its place partly by a delicate
  circular ligament, and partly by the pressure of adjacent structures. It
  is colorless and perfectly transparent, and has a firm but elastic
  texture. In shape it is doubly convex, and may be rudely compared to a
  small lemon-drop. The front face of the lens is flatter than the other,
  and is in contact with the iris near its pupillary margin, as is
  represented in the diagram on page <a href="#page214">214</a>. It is only
  one-fourth of an inch thick.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>74.</b> Cataract? Aqueous humor? Vitreous humor?</div>
  <p><b>74.</b> When this little body becomes opaque, and no longer affords
  free passage to the rays of light, as often happens <!-- Page 210
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page210"></a>{210}</span>with the
  advance of age, an affection termed "cataract" is produced. Between the
  crystalline lens and the cornea is a small space which contains the
  <i>aqueous humor</i> (see Fig. 48, <span class="scac">A</span>). This
  humor consists of five or six drops of a clear, colorless liquid very
  much like water, as its name implies. That part of the globe of the eye
  lying behind the lens is occupied by the <i>vitreous humor</i>, so called
  from its fancied resemblance to melted glass (Fig. 48, <span
  class="scac">V</span>). This humor is a transparent, jelly-like mass,
  enclosed within an exceedingly thin membrane. It lies very closely
  applied to the retina, or nervous membrane of the eye, and constitutes
  fully two-thirds of the bulk of the eyeball.</p>

  </div>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>75.</b> What is a lens and its focus? The miniature image, how produced?</div>
  <p><b>75. The Uses of the Crystalline Lens.</b>&mdash;A convex lens has
  the property of converging the rays of light which pass through it; and
  the point at which it causes them to meet is termed its focus. If a lens
  of this description, such as a magnifying or burning-glass, be held in
  front of an open window, in such a position as to allow its focus to fall
  upon a piece of paper, it will be found to depict upon the paper a
  miniature image of the scene outside of the window. It will be further
  noticed that the image is inverted, or upside down, and that the paper
  <!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page211"></a>{211}</span>at the place upon which the image is
  thrown is much brighter than any other part.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>76.</b> How are figures painted upon the retina? How proved?</div>
  <p><b>76.</b> Now all the transparent structures of the eye, but
  especially the crystalline lens, operate upon its posterior part, or
  retina, as the convex lens acts upon the paper; that is, they paint upon
  the retina a bright inverted miniature of the objects that appear in
  front of the eye (Fig. 50). That this actually takes place may be proved
  by experiment. If the eyeball of a white rabbit, the walls of which are
  transparent, be examined while a lighted candle is held before the
  cornea, an image of the candle-flame may be seen upon the retina.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>77.</b> What can be said in respect to the form and structure of the crystalline lens?</div>
  <p><b>77.</b> The form and structure of the crystalline lens endow it
  with a remarkable degree of refractive power, and enable it to converge
  all the rays of light that enter it through the pupil, to a focus exactly
  at the surface of the retina. When this lens is removed from the eye, as
  is frequently done for the cure of cataract, it is found that the rays of
  light then have their focus three-eighths of an inch behind the retina;
  that the image is four times larger than in the healthy eye, that it is
  less brilliant, and that its outline is very indistinct. From this we
  learn that one of the uses of the crystalline lens is to make the retinal
  image bright and sharply-defined, at the same time that it reduces its
  size. Indeed, the small size of the image is a great advantage, as it
  enables the limited surface of the retina to receive, at a glance,
  impressions from a considerable field of vision.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>78.</b> How is the inverted image upon the retina presented in its true position to the mind?</div>
  <p><b>78.</b> As the image upon the retina is inverted, how does the mind
  perceive the object in its true, erect position? Many explanations have
  been advanced, but the simplest and most satisfactory appears to be found
  in the fact that <!-- Page 212 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page212"></a>{212}</span>the retina observes no difference, so to
  speak, between the right and left or the upper and lower positions of
  objects. In fact, the mind is never conscious of the formation of a
  retinal image, and until instructed, has no knowledge that it exists.
  Consequently, our knowledge of the relative location of external objects
  must be obtained from some other source than the retina. The probable
  source of this knowledge is the habitual comparison of those objects with
  the position of our own bodies: thus, to see an elevated object, we know
  we must raise the head and eyes; and to see one at our right hand, we
  must turn the head and eyes to the right.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>79.</b> The uniform perfection of the eye? Examples? The most common imperfection?</div>
  <p><b>79. Long-sight or Hyperopia, and Short-sight or
  Myopia.</b>&mdash;The eye is not in all cases perfectly formed. For
  example, persons may from birth have the cornea too prominent or too
  flat, or the lens may be too thick or too thin. In either of these
  conditions sight will be more or less defective from the first, and the
  defect will not tend to disappear as life advances. The most common
  imperfection, however, is in the shape of the globe; which may be short
  (Fig. 51, <span class="scac">H</span>), as compared with the natural eye,
  <span class="scac">N</span>, or it may be too long, <span
  class="scac">M</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>80.</b> How is "long-sight" explained? "Short-sight?"</div>
  <p><b>80.</b> When the globe is short, objects can only be clearly <!--
  Page 213 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213"></a>{213}</span>seen
  that are at a distance, and the condition of the vision is known as
  "long-sight," or hyperopia. It will be observed, by reference to Fig. 51,
  that the focus of the rays of light would fall behind the retina of this
  eye. When the globe is too long, objects can only be clearly seen that
  are very near to the eye; and the condition resulting from this defect is
  termed "short-sight," or myopia. The focus of the rays of light is, in
  this case, formed in the interior of the eye in front of the retina.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>81.</b> Long-sight, how common? With what must it not be confounded? Kind of glasses for short-sight? Why? Squint?</div>
  <p><b>81.</b> Long-sight, or hyperopia, is common among schoolchildren,
  nearly as much so as short-sight, and must not be confounded with the
  defect known as the "far sight" of old people; although in both
  affections the sight is improved by the use of convex glasses. Children
  not infrequently discover that they see much better when they chance to
  put on the spectacles of old persons. For the relief of short-sight,
  concave glasses should be employed; as they so scatter the rays of light
  as to bring the focus to the retina, and thus cause the vision of remote
  objects to become at once distinct. That form of "squint," in which the
  eyes are turned inward, is generally dependent upon long-sight, while
  that rarer form, when they turn outward, is due to short-sight.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>82.</b> What is stated in connection with the opera-glass? Experiment with pencil and distant object?</div>
  <p><b>82. The Function of Accommodation.</b>&mdash;If, after looking
  through an opera-glass at a very distant object, it is desired to view
  another nearer at hand, it will be found impossible to obtain a clear
  vision of the second object unless the adjustment of the instrument is
  altered; which is effected by means of the screw. If an object, like the
  end of a pencil, be held near the eye, in a line with another object at
  the other side of the room, or out of the window, and the eye be fixed
  first upon one and then upon the other, it will be found that when the
  pencil is clearly seen, the <!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page214"></a>{214}</span>further object is indistinct; and when the
  latter is seen clearly, the pencil appears indistinct; and that it is
  impossible to see both clearly at the same time. Accordingly, the eye
  must have the capacity of adjusting itself to distances, which is in some
  manner comparable to the action of the screw of the opera-glass.</p>

  </div>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>83.</b> Function of accommodation? In what does it consist? How is the function explained?</div>
  <p><b>83.</b> This, which has been called the function of accommodation,
  is one of the most admirable of all the powers of the eye, and is
  exercised by the crystalline lens. It consists essentially in a change in
  the curvature of the front surface of the lens, partly through its own
  elasticity, and partly through the action of the ciliary muscle. When the
  eye is at rest, that is, when accommodated for a distant object, the lens
  is flatter and its curvature diminished (see Fig. 52); but when strongly
  accommodated for near vision the lens becomes thicker, its curvature
  increases, and the image on the retina is made more sharp and distinct.
  Since a strong light is not required in viewing near objects, the pupil
  contracts, as is shown in the left-hand half of the diagram. <!-- Page

<div class="sidenotee"><b>84.</b> Change of sight with the approach of old age? Explain the change?</div>
  <p><b>84. Old-sight, or Presbyopia.</b>&mdash;But this marvellously
  beautiful mechanism becomes worn with use; or, more strictly speaking,
  the lens, like other structures of the body, becomes harder with the
  approach of old age. The material composing the lens becomes less
  elastic, the power to increase its curvature is gradually lost, and as a
  consequence, the person is obliged to hold the book further away when
  reading, and to seek a stronger light. In a word, the function of
  accommodation begins to fail, and is about the first evidence that marks
  the decline of life. By looking at the last preceding diagram, and
  remembering that the increased curvature of the lens cannot take place,
  it will be at once understood why old-sight is benefitted in near vision
  by the convex lens, such as the spectacles of old people contain. It acts
  as a substitute for the deficiency of the crystalline lens.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>85.</b> Hearing or audition? What is sound? How propagated commonly? Stone thrown in water?</div>
  <p><b>85. The Sense of Hearing.&mdash;Sound.</b>&mdash;Hearing, or
  audition, is the special sense by means of which we are made acquainted
  with <i>sound</i>. What is sound? It is an impression made upon the
  organs of hearing, by the vibrations of elastic bodies. This impression
  is commonly propagated by means of the air, which is thrown into delicate
  undulations, in all directions from the vibrating substance. When a stone
  is thrown into smooth water, a wave of circular form is set in motion,
  from the point where the stone struck, which constantly increases in size
  and diminishes in force, as it advances.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>86.</b> Sound-wave in the atmosphere? Its shape? Rate of motion? Sound, in water, air, and solid bodies?</div>
  <p><b>86.</b> Somewhat resembling this, is the undulation, or sound-wave,
  which is imparted by a sonorous vibration to the surrounding atmosphere.
  Its shape, however, is spherical, rather than circular, since it radiates
  upward, downward, and obliquely as well as horizontally, like the wave
  <!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page216"></a>{216}</span>in water. The rate of motion of this
  spherical wave of air is about 1050 feet per second, or one mile in five
  seconds. In water, sound travels four times as fast as in air, and still
  more rapidly through solid bodies; along an iron rod, its velocity is
  equal to two miles per second.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>87.</b> The earth as a conductor of sound? To what has the western Indian been taught? Solid substances as conductors? As regards sound, in what respect is air necessary? Sound in a vacuum?</div>
  <p><b>87.</b> The earth, likewise, is a good conductor of sound. It is
  said that the Indian of our western prairies can, by listening at the
  surface of the ground, hear the advance of a troop of cavalry, while they
  are still out of sight, and can even discriminate between their tread and
  that of a herd of buffaloes. Solid substances also convey sounds with
  greater power than air. If the ear be pressed against one end of a long
  beam, the scratching of a pin at the other extremity may be distinctly
  heard, which will not be at all audible when the ear is removed from the
  beam. Although air is not the best medium for conveying sound, it is
  necessary for its production. Sound cannot be produced in a vacuum, as is
  shown by ringing a bell in the exhausted receiver of an air-pump, for it
  is then entirely inaudible. But let the air be readmitted gradually, then
  the tones become more and more distinct, and when the receiver is again
  full of air, they will be as clear as usual.</p>

  <p><b>88.</b> All sonorous bodies do not vibrate with the same degree of
  rapidity, and upon this fact depends the <i>pitch</i> of the sounds that
  they respectively produce. The more frequent the number of vibrations
  within a given time, the higher will be the pitch; and the fewer their
  number, the lower or graver will it be. Now, the rate of the successive
  vibrations of different notes has been measured, and it has thus been
  found that if they are less than sixteen in a second, no sound is
  audible; while if they exceed 60,000 per second the sound is very faint,
  and is painful to the <!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page217"></a>{217}</span>ear. The extreme limit of the capacity of
  the human ear may be considered as included between these points; but the
  sounds which we ordinarily hear are embraced between 100 and 3,000
  vibrations per second.</p>

  <p><b>89.</b> The <i>ear</i>, which is the proper organ of hearing, is
  the most complicated of all the structures that are employed in the
  reception of external impressions. The parts of which it is composed are
  numerous, and some of them are extremely small and delicate. Nearly all
  these parts are located in an irregularly shaped cavity hollowed out in
  the temporal, or "temple," bone of each side of the head. That part of
  the bone in which the auditory cavity is placed has the densest structure
  of all bones of the body, and has therefore been called the "petrous," or
  rocky part of the temporal bone. In studying the ear, it is necessary to
  consider it as divided into three portions, which are called, from their
  relative positions, the <i>external</i> ear, the <i>middle</i> ear, and
  the <i>internal</i> ear. (In the diagram, Fig. 53, <span
  class="scac">A</span>, the first is not shaded, the second is lightly
  shaded, and the last has a dark background.)</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>90.</b> Of what does the external portion of the organ of hearing consist? Describe the portal of that organ known as the ear. Its use?</div>
  <p><b>90. The External Ear.</b>&mdash;The external portion of the organ
  of hearing, designated in Fig. 53, <span class="scac">A</span>, includes,
  first, that outer part (<i>a</i>), which is commonly spoken of as "the
  ear," but which in fact is only the portal of that organ; and, secondly,
  the <i>auditory canal</i> (<i>b</i>). The former consists of a flat
  flexible piece of cartilage, projecting slightly from the side of the
  head, attached to it by ligaments, and supplied with a few weak muscles.
  Its surface is uneven, and curiously curved, and from its resemblance to
  a shell, it has been called the <i>concha</i>. It probably serves to
  collect sounds, and to give them an inward direction; although its
  removal is said not to impair the acuteness of hearing more than a few
  days. <!-- Page 218 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page218"></a>{218}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>91.</b> The ear in the animals of delicate hearing? Rabbit? Fishes?</div>
  <p><b>91.</b> In those animals whose hearing is more delicate than that
  of man, the corresponding organ is of greater importance, it being larger
  and supplied with muscles of greater power, so that it serves as a
  natural kind of ear-trumpet, which is easily movable in the direction of
  any sound that attracts the attention of the animal. Bold, predaceous
  animals generally have the concavity of this organ directed forward,
  while in timorous animals, like the rabbit, it is directed backward.
  Fishes have no outer ear, but sounds are transmitted directly through the
  solid bones of the head, to the internal organ of hearing.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>92.</b> What is the auditory canal? Describe it.</div>
  <p><b>92.</b> The <i>auditory canal</i> (Fig. 53, <span
  class="scac">A</span>, <i>b</i>), which is continuous with the outer
  opening of the ear, is a blind passage, an inch and a quarter in length,
  its inner extremity being bounded by a closely-fitting, circular
  membrane. This canal is of oval form, is directed forward and inward,
  <!-- Page 219 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page219"></a>{219}</span>and is slightly curved; so that the inner
  end is ordinarily concealed from view. The pouch of the skin which lines
  this passage is smooth and thin, especially at the lower end, where it
  covers the membrane just mentioned.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>93.</b> How is it guarded and protected? Ear-wax?</div>
  <p><b>93.</b> As in the case of the nostrils, a number of small, stiff
  hairs garnish the margin of the auditory canal, and guard it, to some
  extent, against the entrance of insects and other foreign objects. The
  skin, too, covering its outer half, is furnished with a belt of little
  glands which secrete a yellow, viscid, and bitter substance, called
  "ear-wax," which is especially obnoxious to small insects. As the outer
  layer of this wax-like material loses its useful properties, it becomes
  dry, and falls out of the ear in the form of minute, thin scales, a fresh
  supply being furnished from the little glands beneath. In its form, the
  auditory canal resembles the tube of an ear-trumpet, and serves to convey
  the waves of sound to the middle portion of the ear.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>94.</b> What is the middle ear? Why called tympanum?</div>
  <p><b>94. The Middle Ear, or Tympanum.</b>&mdash;The middle ear is a
  small cavity, or chamber, of irregular shape, about one-fourth of an inch
  across from side to side, and half an inch long (see Fig. 53, <span
  class="scac">A</span>, <i>d</i>). From the peculiar arrangement of its
  various parts it has very properly been called the <i>tympanum</i>, or
  the "drum of the ear." The middle ear, like the external canal, contains
  air.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>95.</b> What is the membrana tympani? Describe it.</div>
  <p><b>95.</b> The circular membrane, already mentioned as closing the
  auditory canal, is the partition which separates the middle from the
  external ear, and is called the <i>membrana tympani</i> (<i>c</i>), and
  may be considered as the outer head of the drum of the ear. It is
  sometimes itself spoken of as the "drum," but this is incorrect; since a
  drum is not a membrane, but is the hollow space across which the membrane
  is stretched. This membranous drum-head is very tense and elastic, and so
  thin as to be almost transparent; <!-- Page 220 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page220"></a>{220}</span>its margin is fastened
  into a circular groove in the adjacent bone. Each wave of sound that
  impinges against this delicate membrane causes it to vibrate, and it, in
  turn, excites movements in the parts beyond.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>96.</b> What are the ossicles? Their number and names? Their arrangement?</div>
  <p><b>96.</b> Within the tympanum is arranged a chain of remarkable
  "little bones," or <i>ossicles</i>. They are chiefly three in number, and
  from their peculiar shapes bear the following names: <i>malleus</i>, or
  the mallet; <i>incus</i>, or the anvil; and <i>stapes</i>, or the
  stirrup. A fourth, the smallest bone in the body, in early life
  intervenes between the incus and stapes, but at a later period it becomes
  a part of the incus. It is called the <i>orbicular</i> bone. Small as are
  these ossicles&mdash;and they, together, weigh only a few
  grains&mdash;they have their little muscles, cartilages, and
  blood-vessels, as perfectly arranged as the larger bones of the body. One
  end of the chain of ossicles, the mallet, is attached to the membrane of
  the tympanum, or outer drum-head, while the other end, the stirrup, is
  firmly joined by its foot-piece to a membrane in the opposite side of the
  cavity. The chain, accordingly, hangs suspended across the drum between
  the two membranes; and when the outer one vibrates under the influence of
  the sound-wave, the chain swings inward and transmits the vibration to
  the entrance of the inner ear.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>97.</b> The Eustachian tube? Describe it, and state its use.</div>
  <p><b>97.</b> The musical instrument, the drum, is not complete if the
  air within be perfectly confined: we therefore find in all instruments of
  this kind a small opening in the side, through which air may pass freely.
  By this means the pressure of the air upon the vellum which forms the
  head of the drum is made equal upon all sides, and the resonance of the
  drum remains unaffected by the varying density of the atmosphere. It
  will, therefore, emit its proper sound, whether it be struck in the
  rarified air of the mountain-top, or in the condensed air of a mine. The
  tympanum, <!-- Page 221 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page221"></a>{221}</span>or drum of the ear, in like manner has an
  opening by means of which it communicates freely with the external air.
  This opening is a narrow canal, about an inch and a half long, called the
  <i>Eustachian tube</i>, after the name of its discoverer, Eustachius.</p>

  </div>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>98.</b> What can you state of the action of the Eustachian tube?</div>
  <p><b>98.</b> The course of this passage is indicated in Fig. 54, <span
  class="scac">I</span>, directed downward and inward: its other extremity
  opens into the upper part of the throat. The passage itself is ordinarily
  closed, but whenever the act of swallowing or gaping takes place, the
  orifice in the throat is stretched open, and the air of the cavity of the
  tympanum may then be renewed. Air may at will be made to enter through
  this tube, by closing the mouth and nose, and then trying <!-- Page 222
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222"></a>{222}</span>to force air
  through the latter. When this is done, a distinct crackle or clicking
  sound is perceived, due to the movement of the membranes, and of the
  little bones of the ear.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>99.</b> What other purpose does the Eustachian tube serve? How is this shown? "Throat-deafness?" Primary use of the Eustachian tube?</div>
  <p><b>99.</b> The Eustachian tube serves, also, as an escape-pipe for the
  fluids which form within the middle ear; and hence, when its lining
  membrane becomes thickened, in consequence of a cold, or sore throat, and
  the passage is thus more or less choked up, the fluids are unable to
  escape as usual, and therefore accumulate within the ear. When this takes
  place, the vibrations of the membrane are interfered with; the sounds
  heard appear muffled and indistinct; and a temporary difficulty of
  hearing, which is known as "throat-deafness," is the result. This result
  resembles the effect produced by interrupting the vibrations of a
  sonorous body, such as all are familiar with; if the finger be placed
  upon a piano-string or bell when it is struck, the proper sound is no
  longer fully and clearly emitted. But the primary use of this tube is to
  afford a free communication between the middle ear and the external
  atmosphere, and thus secure an equal pressure upon both sides of the
  membrane of the drum of the ear, however the density of the atmosphere
  may vary. If, from undue tension of the membranes, pain is experienced in
  the ears, when ascending into a rare atmosphere, as in a balloon, or
  descending into a dense one, as in a diving-bell, it may be relieved by
  repeating the act of swallowing, from time to time, in order that the
  inner and outer pressure may thus be promptly equalized.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>100.</b> The essential part of the organ of hearing? Its location? Formation?</div>
  <p><b>100. The Internal Ear, or Labyrinth.</b>&mdash;The most essential
  part of the organ of hearing is the distribution of the <i>auditory
  nerve</i>. This is found within the cavity of the internal ear, which,
  from its exceedingly tortuous shape, <!-- Page 223 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page223"></a>{223}</span>has been termed the
  <i>labyrinth</i> (see Fig. 53, <span class="scac">C</span>). This cavity
  is hollowed out in dense bone, and consists of three parts; the
  <i>vestibule</i> (<i>a</i>), or ante-chamber, which is connected with the
  other two; the <i>cochlea</i> (<i>b</i>), or snail's shell; and the three
  <i>semicircular canals</i> (<i>c</i>). The manner in which the nerve of
  hearing is distributed is remarkable, and is peculiar to this nerve. In
  the vestibule and the canals its fibres are spread out over the inner
  surface, not of the bony cavity but of a membranous bag, which conforms
  to and partially fills that cavity; and which floats in it, being both
  filled and surrounded with a clear, limpid fluid.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>101.</b> Where is the "ear-sand" found? Give the theory as to its use.</div>
  <p><b>101.</b> A singular addition to the mechanism of hearing is
  observed within this membranous bag of the labyrinth. This consists of
  two small oval ear-stones, and a quantity of fine powder of a calcareous
  nature, which is called "ear-sand." When examined under the microscope,
  these sandy particles are seen to lie scattered upon and among the
  delicate filaments of the auditory nerve; and it is probable, that as the
  tremulous sound-wave traverses the fluid of the vestibule, the sand rises
  and falls upon the nerve filaments, and thus intensifies the sonorous
  impression.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>102.</b> In the cochlea or snail's shell? "Key-board" in the internal ear? The vestibules? Semicircular canals?</div>
  <p><b>102.</b> In the cochlea, or snail's shell, which contains the
  fluid, but no membrane, the nerve ramifies upon a spiral shelf, which,
  like the cochlea itself, takes two and a half turns, growing continuously
  smaller as it winds upward. As many as three thousand nerve fibres of
  different lengths have been counted therein; which, it has been thought,
  form the grand, yet minutely small key-board, upon which strike all the
  musical tones that are destined to be conveyed to the brain. The
  vestibule, it is also supposed, takes cognizance of noise as
  distinguished from musical sounds; while the office of the semicircular
  canals is, in part at least, to prevent internal echoes, or
  reverberations. <!-- Page 224 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page224"></a>{224}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>103.</b> With what does the vestibule communicate? What is the theory by which sound is conducted to the brain?</div>
  <p><b>103.</b> The vestibule communicates with the chain of bones of the
  middle ear by means of a small opening, called the "oval window," or
  <i>fenestra ovalis</i>. Across this window is stretched the membrane,
  which has already been alluded to as being joined to the stirrup-bone of
  the middle ear. Through this window, then, the sound-wave, which
  traverses the external and middle ear, arrives at last at the labyrinth.
  The limpid fluid which the latter contains, and which bathes the terminal
  fibres of the nerve of hearing, is thus agitated, the nerve-fibres are
  excited, and a sonorous impression is conducted to the brain, or, as we
  say, a sound is heard.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>104.</b> The formation of the organ of hearing with a view to its protection?</div>
  <p><b>104. Protection of the Sense of Hearing.</b>&mdash;From what has
  been seen of the complicated parts which compose the organ of hearing, it
  is evident that while many of them possess an exquisite delicacy of
  structure, Nature has well and amply provided for their protection. We
  have observed the concealed situation of the most important parts of the
  mechanism of the ear, the length of its cavity, its partitions, the
  hardness of its walls, and its communication with the atmosphere; all
  these provisions rendering unnecessary any supervision or care on our
  part in reference to the interior of the ear. But in respect to its
  external parts, which are under our control and within the reach of harm,
  it is otherwise. We may both observe the dangers which threaten them, and
  learn the means necessary to protect them.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>105.</b> Danger to which the hearing may be subjected? Advice?</div>
  <p><b>105.</b> One source of danger to the hearing consists in lowering
  the temperature of the ear, especially by the introduction of cold water
  into the auditory canal. Every one is familiar with the unpleasant
  sensation of distension and the confusion of sounds which accompany the
  filling of the ear with water when bathing: the weight of the <!-- Page
  225 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page225"></a>{225}</span>water
  within it really distends the membrane, and the cold chills the adjacent
  sensitive parts. It is not surprising, therefore, that the frequent
  introduction of cold water and its continued presence in the ear enfeeble
  the sense of hearing. Care should be taken to remove water from the ear
  after bathing, by holding the head on one side, and, at the same time,
  slightly expanding the outer orifice, so that the fluid may run out. For
  a like reason, the hair about the ears should not be allowed to remain
  wet, but should be thoroughly dried as soon as possible.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>106.</b> The general rule as to the use of water for the ear?</div>
  <p><b>106.</b> It may be stated as a general rule, to which there are but
  few exceptions, that no cold liquid should ever be allowed to enter the
  ear. When a wash or injection is rendered necessary, it should always be
  warmed before use. The introduction of cold air is likewise hurtful,
  especially when it pours through a crevice directly into the ear, as it
  may often do through the broken or partially closed window of a car. The
  avoidance of this evil gives rise to another almost as great; namely, the
  introduction of cotton or other soft substances into the ear to prevent
  it from "catching cold." This kind of protection tends to make the part
  unnaturally susceptible to changes of temperature, and its security seems
  to demand the continued presence of the "warm" covering. As a consequence
  of its presence, sounds are not naturally conveyed, and the sensitiveness
  of the nerve of hearing is gradually impaired.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>107.</b> Chief source of injury to the ear? Directions for removing foreign objects from the ear? Of a live insect?</div>
  <p><b>107.</b> The chief source of injury, however, to the ear is from
  the introduction of solid substances into the auditory canal, with the
  design of removing insects or other foreign objects that have found their
  way into the ear; or with the design of scraping out the ear-wax. For
  displacing a foreign object, it is usually sufficient to syringe the ear
  gently with warm water, the head being so held that the <!-- Page 226
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page226"></a>{226}</span>fluid easily
  escapes. If a live insect has gained entrance to the ear, it may first be
  suffocated by pouring a little oil upon it, and afterward removed by
  syringing the ear as just mentioned.</p>

  <p><b>108.</b> The removal of ear-wax is generally unnecessary; for, as
  we have before seen, Nature provides that the excess of it shall become
  dry, and then spontaneously fall out in the form of fine scales. The
  danger from the introduction of solid implements into the outer ear is
  chiefly found in the fact that the membrane which lies at the bottom of
  it is very fragile, and that any injury of it is liable to be permanent,
  and to permanently impair the hearing of the injured ear.</p>

</blockquote>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>1.</b> The uttering of sounds by animals? How produced?</div>
  <p><b>1. Voice and Speech.</b>&mdash;In common with the majority of the
  nobler animals, man possesses the power of uttering sounds, which are
  employed as a means of communication and expression. In man, these sounds
  constitute the voice; in the animals, they are designated as the cry. The
  song of the bird is a modification of its cry, which is rendered possible
  from the fact that its respiratory function is remarkably active. The
  sounds of the animals are generally, but not always, produced by means of
  their breathing organs. Among the insects, they are sometimes produced by
  the extremely rapid vibrations of the wings in the act of flight, as in
  the case of the musquito; or they are produced by the rubbing together of
  hard portions of the external covering of the body, as in the cricket.
  Almost all kinds of marine animals are voiceless. The tambour-fish and a
  few others have, however, the power of making a sort of noise in the
  water.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>2.</b> The evidence of man's superior endowment? What is stated of the idiot? Parrot? Raven?</div>
  <p><b>2.</b> But man alone possesses the faculty of speech, or the power
  to use articulate sounds in the expression of ideas, and in the
  communication of mind with mind. Speech is thus an evidence of the
  superior endowment of man, and involves the culture of the intellect. An
  idiot, while he <!-- Page 228 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page228"></a>{228}</span>may have complete vocal organs and full
  power of uttering sounds or cries, is entirely incapable of speech; and,
  as a rule, the excellence of the language of any people will be found to
  be proportional to their development of brain. Man, however, is not the
  only being that has the power to form articulate sounds, for the parrot
  and the raven may also be taught to speak by rote; but man alone attaches
  meaning to the words and phrases he employs.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>3.</b> Speech and hearing? A deaf child? Person having "no ear for music?" Impaired hearing? What do the examples show?</div>
  <p><b>3.</b> Speech is intimately related to the sense of hearing. A
  child born deaf is, of necessity, dumb also; not because the organs of
  speech are imperfect, for he can utter cries and may be taught to speak,
  and even to converse in a rude and harsh kind of language; but because he
  can form no accurate notion of sound. And a person, whose hearing is not
  delicate, or as it is commonly expressed, who "has no ear for music,"
  cannot sing correctly. A person who has impaired hearing commonly talks
  in an unnaturally loud and monotonous voice. These examples show the
  necessary relation of intelligence and the sense of hearing with that
  form of articulate voice, which is termed speech.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>4.</b> Organ of the voice? Where situated? Of what is its framework composed?</div>
  <p><b>4. The Organ of the Voice.</b>&mdash;The essential organ of the
  voice is the Larynx. This has been previously alluded to in its relation
  to the function of respiration; and, in the chapter on that subject, are
  figured the front view of that organ (Fig. 35), and its connection with
  the trachea, tongue, and other neighboring parts (Fig. 38). It is
  situated at the upper part of the neck, at the top of the trachea, or
  tube by which air passes into and out of the lungs. The framework of the
  larynx is composed of four cartilages, which render it at once very
  strong and sufficiently flexible to enable it to move according to the
  requirements of the voice. <!-- Page 229 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page229"></a>{229}</span></p>

    C,&nbsp;Arytenoid Cartilage. D,&nbsp;Ventricle of the Larynx. E,&nbsp;Cricoid
    Cartilage. F,&nbsp;Right Vocal Cord. H,&nbsp;The Trachea.</p>
  </div>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>5.</b> Names, formation, and situation of the cartilages?</div>
  <p><b>5.</b> The names of the cartilages are (1) the <i>thyroid</i>,
  which is a broad thin plate, bent in the middle and placed in the central
  line of the front part of the neck, where it is known as the <i>pomum
  Adami</i>, or Adam's apple (Fig. 55, <span class="scac">B</span>), and
  where it may be felt moving up and down with each act of swallowing; (2)
  the <i>cricoid</i>, which is shaped like a seal ring, with the broad part
  placed posteriorly (Fig. 55, <span class="scac">E</span>). At the top of
  the cricoid cartilage are situated the two small <i>arytenoid</i>
  cartilages, the right one of which is shown in Fig. 55, <span
  class="scac">C</span>. These latter little organs are much more movable
  than the other two, and are very important in the production of the
  voice. They have a true ball and socket joint, and several small muscles
  which contract and relax with as perfect regularity and accuracy as any
  of the larger muscles of the body.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>6.</b> Lining of the interior of the larynx? The epiglottis?</div>
  <p><b>6.</b> The interior of the larynx is lined with a very sensitive
  mucous membrane, which is much more closely adherent to the parts beneath
  than is usually the case with membranes of this description. The
  epiglottis (<span class="scac">A</span>), consisting of a single
  leaf-shaped piece of cartilage, is attached to the front part of the
  larynx. It is elastic, easily moved, and fits accurately over the
  entrance to the air-passages below it. Its office is to guard these
  delicate passages and the lungs against the intrusion of food and other
  foreign <!-- Page 230 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page230"></a>{230}</span>articles, when the act of swallowing takes
  place. It also assists in modifying the voice.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>7.</b> Where are the vocal cords? The false cords? The true cords?</div>
  <p><b>7. The Vocal Cords.</b>&mdash;Within the larynx, and stretched
  across it from the thyroid cartilage in front to the arytenoid cartilages
  behind, are placed the two sets of folds, called the vocal cords. The
  upper of these, one on each side, are the false cords, which are
  comparatively fixed and inflexible. These are not at all essential to the
  formation of vocal sounds, for they have been injured, in those lower
  animals whose larynx resembles that of man, without materially affecting
  their characteristic cries. Below these, one on each side, are the true
  vocal cords (Fig. 55, <span class="scac">F</span>), which pursue a
  similar direction to the false cords, namely, from before backward. But
  they are composed of a highly elastic, though strong tissue, and are
  covered with a thin, tightly-fitting layer of mucous membrane. Their
  edges are smooth and sharply defined, and when they meet, as they do in
  the formation of sounds, they exactly match each other.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>8.</b> Where is the ventricle of the larynx? The essentials to the formation of the tones and modulation of the voice?</div>
  <p><b>8.</b> Between the true and false vocal cords is a depression on
  each side, which is termed the ventricle of the larynx (Fig. 55, <span
  class="scac">D</span>). The integrity of these true cords, and their free
  vibration, are essential to the formation of the tones and the modulation
  of the natural voice. This is shown by the fact that, if one or both of
  these cords are injured or become diseased, voice and speech are
  compromised; or when the mucous membrane covering them becomes thickened,
  in consequence of a cold, the vocal sounds are rendered husky and
  indistinct. When an opening is made in the throat below the cords, as not
  infrequently happens in consequence of an attempt to commit suicide,
  voice is impossible except when the opening is closed by external
  pressure. <!-- Page 231 --><span class="pagenum"><a

    <span class="sc">Fig. 56. A View of the Vocal Cords by Means of the
    Laryngoscope.</span>
  </div>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>9.</b> Variation in the interval between the true cords of the voice? Experiment with the mirror?</div>
  <p><b>9.</b> The interval or space between the true cords of the voice is
  constantly varying, not only when their vocal function is in exercise,
  but also during the act of respiration. Every time the lungs are
  inflated, the space increases to make wide the entrance for the air; and
  diminishes slightly during expiration. So that these little cords move
  gently to and fro in rhythm with the expansion and contraction of the
  chest in breathing. These movements and others may be seen to take place,
  if a small mirror attached to a long handle be placed back into the upper
  part of the throat; the handle near the mirror must be bent at an angle
  of 45°, so that we may look "around the corner," so to speak, behind the
  tongue. The position which the mirror must assume will be understood by
  reference to Fig. 38. A view of what may be seen under favorable
  circumstances, during tranquil inspiration is represented in Fig. 56. The
  vocal cords are there shown as narrow, white bands, on each side of the
  central opening, and since the image is inverted, the epiglottis appears
  uppermost. The rings partly seen through the opening belong to the
  trachea. This little mirror is the essential part <!-- Page 232 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page232"></a>{232}</span>of an instrument, which
  is called the laryngoscope, and, simple as it may seem, it is accounted
  one of the most valuable of the recently invented appliances of the
  medical art.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>10.</b> The formation of true vocal tones?</div>
  <p><b>10. The Production of the Voice.</b>&mdash;During ordinary tranquil
  breathing no sound is produced in the larynx, true vocal tones being
  formed only during forcible expiration, when, by an effort of the will,
  the cords are brought close together, and are stretched so as to be very
  tense. The space between them is then reduced to a narrow slit, at times
  not more than 1/100 of an inch in width; and the column of expired air
  being forced through it causes the cords to vibrate rapidly, like the
  strings of a musical instrument. Thus the voice is produced in its many
  varieties of tone and pitch; its intensity, or loudness, depending
  chiefly upon the power exerted in expelling the air from the lungs. When
  the note is high, the space is diminished both in length and width; but
  when it is low, the space is wider and longer (Fig. 57, <span
  class="scac">B</span>, <span class="scac">C</span>), and the number of
  vibrations is fewer within the same period of time.</p>

  </div>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>11.</b> To what is the personal quality of the voice mainly due? What aids are there?</div>
  <p><b>11.</b> The personal quality of the voice, or that which enables us
  to recognize a person by his speech, is mainly due to the peculiar shape
  of the throat, nose, and mouth, and <!-- Page 233 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page233"></a>{233}</span>the resonance of the
  air contained within those cavities. The walls of the chest and the
  trachea take part in the resonance of the voice, the air within them
  vibrating at the same time with the parts above them. This may be tested
  by touching the throat or breast-bone, when a strong vocal effort is
  made. The teeth and the lips also are important, as is shown by the
  unnatural tones emitted by a person who has lost the former, or by one
  who is affected with the deformity known as "hare-lip." The tongue is
  useful, but not indispensable to speech; the case of a woman is reported,
  from whom nearly the whole tongue had been torn out, but who could,
  nevertheless, speak distinctly and even sing.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>12.</b> Varieties of voice? The baritone? The voice in early youth?</div>
  <p><b>12. The varieties</b> of voice are said to be four in number; two,
  the bass and tenor, belonging to the male sex; and two, the contralto or
  alto, and soprano, peculiar to the female. The baritone voice is the name
  given to a variety intervening between the bass and tenor. In man, the
  voice is strong and grave; in woman, soft and high. In infancy and early
  youth, the voice is the same in both sexes, being of the soprano variety:
  that of boys is both clear and loud, and being susceptible of
  considerable training, is highly prized in the choral services of the
  church and cathedral. At about fourteen years of age the voice is said to
  change; that is, it becomes hoarse and unsteady by reason of the rapid
  growth of the larynx. In the case of the girl, the change is not very
  marked, except that the voice becomes stronger and has a wider compass;
  but in the boy, the larynx nearly doubles its size in a single year, the
  vocal cords grow thicker, longer, and coarser, and the voice becomes
  masculine in character. During the progress of this change, the use of
  the voice in singing is injudicious.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>13.</b> The range of the voice? Result of careful training of the vocal organs?</div>
  <p><b>13.</b> The ordinary range of each of the four varieties of <!--
  Page 234 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"></a>{234}</span>the
  voice is about two octaves; but this is exceeded in the case of several
  celebrated vocalists. Madame Parepa-Rosa has a compass of three full
  octaves. When the vocal organs have been subjected to careful training,
  and are brought under complete control of the will, the tension of the
  cords become exact, and their vibrations become exceedingly precise and
  true. Under these circumstances the voice is said to possess "purity" of
  tone, and can be heard at a great distance, and above a multitude of
  other sounds. The power of a pure voice to make itself heard was recently
  exemplified in a striking manner: at a musical festival held in an
  audience-room of extraordinary size, and amid an orchestra of a thousand
  instruments and a chorus of twelve thousand voices, the artist named
  above also sang; yet such was the purity and strength of her voice that
  its notes could be clearly heard rising above the vast waves of sound
  produced by the full accompaniment of chorus and orchestra.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>14.</b> The production of the articulate sounds? What experiment is mentioned?</div>
  <p><b>14.</b> In the production of the articulate sounds of speech, the
  larynx is not directly concerned, but those sounds really depend upon
  alterations in the shape of the air-passages above that organ. That
  speech is not necessarily due to the action of the larynx is proven by
  the following simple experiment. Let an elastic tube be passed through
  the nostril to the back of the mouth. Then, while the breath is held,
  cause the tongue, teeth, and lips to go through the form of pronouncing
  words, and at the same time, let a second person blow through the tube
  into the mouth. Speech, pure and simple, or, in other words, a whisper is
  produced. Still further continue the experiment, while permitting vocal
  sounds to be made, and there will be produced a loud and whispering
  speech at the same moment; thus showing that voice and speech are the
  result of two distinct acts. Sighing, in like manner, is <!-- Page 235
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page235"></a>{235}</span>produced in
  the mouth and throat; if, however, a vocal sound be added, the sigh is
  changed into a groan.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>15.</b> What is ventriloquism? Indication of the original meaning of the word? How are the ventriloquous sounds produced?</div>
  <p><b>15. Ventriloquism</b> is a peculiar modification of natural speech,
  which consists in so managing the voice that words and sounds appear to
  issue, not from the person, but from some distant place, as from the
  chimney, cellar, or the interior of a chest. The original meaning of the
  word ventriloquism (that is, speaking from the belly), indicates the
  early belief that this mode of speech was dependent upon the possession
  and use of some special organ besides the larynx and mouth; but at the
  present time, it is known that it is produced by these organs alone, and
  that the sources of deception consist on the part of the performer, in
  the dexterous management of the voice, together with a talent for
  mimicry; and, on the part of the auditory, in the liability of the sense
  of hearing to error in respect to the direction of sounds. The
  ventriloquist not only seems to "throw his voice," as it is said, or
  simulates the sound as it usually appears at a distance with but little
  motion of the lips and face, but he imitates the voices of an infant and
  of a feeble old man, of a drunken man disputing with an exasperated wife,
  the broken language of a foreigner, the cry of an animal in distress,
  demonstrating that the performer must be proficient in the art of
  mimicry. Ventriloquism was known to the ancient Romans and Greeks; and it
  is thought that the mysterious responses that were said to issue from the
  sacred trees and shrines of the oracles at Dodona and Delphi, were really
  uttered by priests who had the power of producing this form of
  speech.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">The Use of the Microscope in the Study of Physiology.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>1.</b> The will of the Creator, by what obeyed? The power of a muscle? Amount of duty performed by the liver?</div>
  <p><b>1. The Law of the Tissues.</b>&mdash;The will of an infinite
  Creator is obeyed by atoms as well as by worlds. He has seen fit to
  commit all the functions of life to structures or tissues so small as to
  be invisible to the naked eye. A muscle, for example, as we have already
  learned, is composed of innumerable filaments, visible only by the aid of
  the microscope; and the power of the muscular mass is but the sum of the
  contractile power of the filaments which enter into its composition.
  Again, each cell of the liver, invisible to unassisted sight, is a
  secreting organ, and the liver performs as much duty as the sum of these
  minute organs renders possible and no more.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>2.</b> Necessity for using the microscope? The advantages gained by its use?</div>
  <p><b>2. The Necessity of the Microscope.</b>&mdash;If, therefore, we
  would know the real structure of the human body, we must make use of the
  microscope. We are not at liberty either to use it or not; we <i>must</i>
  have recourse to it in order to obtain a real knowledge of the human
  body. Our eyes are constructed for the common offices of life, to provide
  for our wants and guard us from the ordinary sources of danger; but by
  arming them with <i>lenses</i>, the real structure of plants and animals
  is revealed to our intelligence; and enemies, otherwise invisible, that
  lie in wait in the air we breathe, and in our daily food and drink, to
  destroy life, are guarded against.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>3.</b> What are convex lenses? Kind of lenses used in microscopes? Experiment? Picture thrown upon the eye? Derivation of the word microscope?</div>
  <p><b>3. Convex lenses</b>, or magnifying glasses, are disks of glass or
  other transparent substance, which have the <!-- Page 237 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page237"></a>{237}</span>property of picturing
  upon the retina of the eye an image of an object larger than the image
  produced there without their aid. The glasses used in microscopes are
  either double convex lenses (<i>a</i>) or plano-convex lenses (<i>b</i>).
  If a double convex lens or a plano-convex one be placed over a hole in
  the shutter of a darkened room, or over the key-hole of a door, and a
  piece of paper be held at a proper distance, a picture of all objects in
  front of the lens will be thrown on the paper, as in the camera-obscura
  or the magic-lantern. Now, in the same manner, a lens throws a picture of
  objects to which it is directed on the retina of the eye, and when that
  picture is larger than the image made in the eye by the object, without
  the aid of the lens, it is magnified, or the lens has served as a
  <i>microscope</i>, so called, from its use in seeing small objects, from
  <i>mikros</i>, small, and <i>skopeo</i>, to see.</p>

  Magnifying glasses, mounted in frames such as are for sale by opticians
  and others, for the detection of counterfeit money, are simple

  <p><b>5.</b> The most powerful simple microscopes are made by melting in
  a flame a thread of spun glass, so as to form a <!-- Page 238 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page238"></a>{238}</span>minute globule or bead,
  which, when set in a piece of metal and used to examine objects on a
  plate of glass held up to the light, gives a high magnifying power. In
  practice, however, it is found better to use several magnifying glasses
  of moderate power, than a simple lens alone of high power. A combination
  of two lenses is called a <i>doublet</i>&mdash;of three, a
  <i>triplet</i>. All <i>simple</i> microscopes throw an enlarged image of
  the object upon the retina. <i>Compound</i> microscopes are so
  constructed that the enlarged image of an object is again magnified by a
  second lens, and hence their magnifying power is vastly superior to that
  of simple microscopes.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>6.</b> Explain, by means of the diagram, the action of the compound microscope.</div>
  <p><b>6.</b> The accompanying diagrams will explain the action of the
  compound microscope compared with that of the simple microscope. In Fig.
  58, which represents the working of the simple microscope, the rays from
  the object (<i>a b</i>), passing through the lens (<span
  class="scac">L</span>), form an image (<i>a' b'</i>) in the retina of the
  eye (<span class="scac">E</span>), and as all images are inverted in the
  eye, the object is seen as all other objects are, and appears erect. In
  Fig. 59 is seen the action of the compound microscope. An inverted image
  (<i>a' b'</i>) of the object (<i>a b</i>) is magnified by the second lens
  (<span class="scac">L</span>'), and an erect image is thrown upon the
  retina, which, as all other objects seen erect with the naked eye are
  inverted, gives to the image a contrary direction, or inverts it to the
  mind.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>7.</b> Portions, in a compound microscope? The glasses?</div>
  <p><b>7. A Compound Microscope</b> consists of two portions: the optical
  portion, or the lenses, and the mechanical portion, or the instrument
  which bears the lenses. The glasses of a compound microscope are two: the
  <i>object-glass</i> (<span class="scac">D</span>), Fig. 60, and the lower
  lens of Fig. 59, and the <i>ocular</i> or <i>eye-piece</i> (<span
  class="scac">A</span>), Fig. 60, and the upper piece of Fig. 59. Both the
  object-glass and the eye-piece may, and usually do, consist of more than
  one lens, for, as previously mentioned, better results are obtained by a
  combination of lenses of moderate power than by single lenses of high
  power and great curvature.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>8.</b> How to choose a microscope? How to use it?</div>
  <p><b>8. How to choose and use a Microscope.</b>&mdash;No attractiveness
  in the mechanical part of a microscope can compensate for inferior
  lenses; and the very first consideration in the choice of an instrument
  should be the excellence of the optical part of the instrument. In the
  use of the instrument, care should be exercised to keep the lenses clean,
  free from dust, not to press the object-glass upon the object under
  observation, and not to wet it in the water in which most objects are
  examined. A good microscope requires its own table; and when not in use
  should be covered by a bell glass or a clean linen cloth.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>9.</b> The characteristics of the best instrument? What special requisites should be insisted upon? Why, as to a horizontal stage?</div>
  <p><b>9.</b> The mechanical portion of the instrument varies greatly in
  different instruments. That one is the best which is simplest, the most
  solid and easily managed. The stage (<span class="scac">E</span>), upon
  which the object is placed, should not be movable: it should be solid and
  firm. The screw by which the focal distance is adjusted, and which <!--
  Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page241"></a>{241}</span>is in
  constant use, should be so placed that it can be worked by the hand
  resting on the table: otherwise fatigue is soon induced. The direction of
  the tube carrying the glasses should be perpendicular, and the stage
  therefore horizontal. Most objects in human anatomy are examined in water
  or in other liquids, or they are themselves liquids; hence an oblique
  stage is often inconvenient.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>10.</b> Slides? Covers, square and circular? How kept?</div>
  <p><b>10. Additional Apparatus.</b>&mdash;As almost all objects in human
  anatomy are examined by transmitted light thrown up from the mirror
  (<span class="scac">G</span>, Fig. 60) beneath the stage through the
  object to the eye, they must be placed upon strips of clear glass about
  three inches long and one inch wide, commonly called "slides." These
  should be procured with the microscope. Again, most objects seen with
  high powers require to be covered with a thin plate of glass, very
  properly called a "cover," that the moisture of the specimen may not
  tarnish the object-glass. Square or circular covers of very thin glass
  are therefore provided; and a good supply of these should be always on
  hand. These glasses should be kept in a covered dish filled with a
  mixture of alcohol and water. Simple water will not remove the fatty
  matter which exists in all animal tissues, and, therefore, the glasses
  cannot be thoroughly cleaned with it alone.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>11.</b> Cleaning the glasses? Knives, scissors, etc.? Various liquids?</div>
  <p><b>11.</b> When glasses are required for use, they should be removed
  from the liquid and wiped clean and dry with a soft linen handkerchief.
  Delicate knives, scissors, needles mounted in handles, forceps, pipettes
  or little tubes for taking up water, should be obtained; these are
  essential to all microscopical study. The table should be supplied with
  glass-stoppered bottles containing the various liquids ordinarily used in
  the study of physiology. Thus, tincture of iodine is indispensable in
  studying vegetable structure, acetic acid in the study of animal tissues;
  and other articles will have to be added from time to time, as your
  progress in study demands them. <!-- Page 243 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page243"></a>{243}</span></p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>12.</b> Bodies, in air and water? The examination of starch?</div>
  <p><b>12. Preliminary Studies.</b>&mdash;In order to prepare the way for
  the study of any department of science with the aid of the
  microscope&mdash;for the microscope is but an eye, and can be turned in
  almost any direction for purposes of investigation&mdash;it is necessary
  to become acquainted with the many objects which are liable to complicate
  the examination of particular structures. Both air and water are full of
  floating bodies, and the most common of these should first occupy the
  attention. In the city, particles of starch are always floating in the
  air. Take a very minute portion of wheat flour, place it in the middle of
  a clean glass "slide," drop upon it a drop of pure water, cover it with a
  plate of thin glass, and examine it with a power of from one hundred to
  six hundred diameters. It will be found to be composed of minute grains
  or granules, the largest of which are made up of coats or layers, like an
  onion, arranged around a central spot called the <i>hilum</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>13.</b> The examination with solution of iodine? Advice respecting other articles?</div>
  <p><b>13.</b> Make another preparation in the same manner, and, after
  adding the water and before covering with the thin glass cover, add a
  small drop of a solution of iodine. Now, upon examining the specimen,
  every grain will be seen to be of a beautiful deep blue color. After thus
  studying wheat starch, the starch of Indian corn, of arrowroot, and of
  various grains should be examined in like manner, and their resemblances
  and differences noted. The granules of potato-starch are as distinctly
  marked as any. (See Fig. 15, page <a href="#page61">61</a>.)</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>14.</b> Directions for examining cotton and other fibres? Vegetable hairs?</div>
  <p><b>14.</b> Fibres of cotton, lint, and wool are liable to be found in
  every specimen prepared for microscopical examination. In order to study
  these, any cotton, woollen, or linen fabric, or garment, may be scraped,
  and the scrapings placed on a piece of glass moistened with water,
  covered with the thin glass plate or cover as before, and <!-- Page 244
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page244"></a>{244}</span>examined with
  the same magnifying power, namely, from one hundred to six hundred
  diameters. Vegetable hairs or down are constantly floating in air and
  water. These are of very various forms, are simple or grouped, and form
  very interesting objects of study. They are readily procured from the
  epidermis or outer membrane of the leaves or stems of plants, by section
  with a delicate knife.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>15.</b> Directions for examining various tissues? Down of moths, and other structures?</div>
  <p><b>15.</b> The tissues of plants, epidermis, ducts, and woody fibres
  are constantly found in microscopic preparations. They may be studied in
  delicate sections made with a sharp knife, or by tearing vegetable
  tissues apart with needles. The down of moths, the hairs of different
  animals, the fibres of paper, the most common animalcules in water, the
  dust of shelves, and generally the structures found in all vegetable and
  animal substances by which we are surrounded, should be studied as a
  preliminary to any special line of microscopical investigation.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>16.</b> Directions for examining a drop of blood?</div>
  <p><b>16. The Study of Human Tissues.</b>&mdash;When this has been done
  and familiarity with the use of the instrument has been obtained, proceed
  to the study of the human body, for human physiology is our subject. If
  the end of the finger be pricked with a pin, a drop of blood may be
  procured for examination. Place this on one of the glass slides, cover it
  with a thin piece of glass, press down the cover so as to make a thin
  layer, and then examine with the magnifying power just mentioned. Do not
  add water, for that will cause the blood corpuscles to disappear. If the
  drop of blood is placed under the microscope at once after being drawn
  from the finger, most interesting phenomena will be observed. The red
  corpuscles will be seen to arrange themselves in rows, like piles of
  coin, while the blood is coagulating. The spherical, white corpuscles
  will <!-- Page 245 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page245"></a>{245}</span>be left out of the rows of red disks, and,
  if the highest power be used, will be seen to change their shape
  constantly.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>17.</b> Examination of the scales of the mouth? Dandruff?</div>
  <p><b>17.</b> If you scrape with a dull knife the inside of the cheek,
  the flattened scales of "pavement epithelium," or of the insensible
  covering which, analogous to the scarf-skin on the outer surface of the
  body, lines the cavities of its interior, may be readily studied. They
  have the appearance of transparent tiles, each enclosing a round or oval
  body, called its nucleus. Dandruff and the scrapings from the skin of the
  body are composed of scales like those of the mouth, but they differ
  somewhat in being hardened by horny matter, and in having a very faint
  central body or nucleus.</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>18.</b> In what, as respects the tissues, do the warm blooded animals differ? Statement of Milne Edwards?</div>
  <p><b>18. The Tissues of the Inferior Animals.</b>&mdash;The warm-blooded
  animals do not differ in the tissues, or microscopic structures, that
  compose them, but only in the amount and arrangement of these tissues.
  Milne Edwards says these tissues "do not differ much in different
  animals, but their mode of association varies; and it is chiefly by
  reason of the differences in the combination of these associations in
  various degrees, that each species possesses the anatomical properties
  and characters which are peculiar to it."</p>

<div class="sidenotee"><b>19.</b> How to procure materials for the study of the tissues of man?</div>
  <p><b>19.</b> Hence the butcher's stall will furnish all the materials
  for the study of the microscopic tissues. The structure of the heart,
  lungs, liver, brain, and muscle may all be studied, and well studied, by
  using minute pieces of the flesh of the lower animals, especially of the
  quadrupeds. Such portions of these animals as are not exposed for sale
  can be readily obtained by order from the slaughter-house. To examine
  with the powers of which we have been speaking, it is only necessary to
  cut off <!-- Page 246 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page246"></a>{246}</span>exceedingly small pieces, tear them apart
  with needles, or make very delicate sections with a sharp knife.</p>

  <p><b>20. Incentives to Study.</b>&mdash;A complete knowledge of all
  minute structures is not to be expected at once, for you are here
  introduced into a new realm of Nature, a world of little things as vast,
  as wonderful, and as carefully constructed as the starry
  firmament,&mdash;that other realm of grand objects which the astronomer
  nightly scans with the telescope. It will not appear singular, therefore,
  if, at first, you feel strange and awkward in this new creation. With a
  little perseverance, however, and with the attention directed toward
  simple objects at the outset, it will not be long before an increasing
  experience will engender confidence.</p>

  <p><b>21.</b> If to all this there be added an enthusiastic study of the
  standard authorities on the subject, the rate of progress will be by so
  much the more rapid. As compared with similar studies, few possess more
  interest than microscopy, and to the one who pursues it with fondness, it
  constantly affords sources of pleasure and agreeable surprises; and in
  the end, often leads to new and valuable additions to the sum of human
  knowledge. The depths which the microscope is employed to fathom are no
  more completely known, than are the heights above us explored and
  comprehended by the astronomer.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>

<p class="cenhead">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&bull;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h3>POISONS AND THEIR ANTIDOTES.</h3>

  <p>Accidents from poisoning are of such frequent occurrence, that every
  one should be able to administer the more common antidotes, until the
  <i>services of a physician can be obtained</i>. As many poisons bear a
  close resemblance to articles in common use, no dangerous substance
  should be brought into the household without having the word
  <i>poison</i> plainly written or printed on the label; and any package,
  box, or vial, without a label, should be at once destroyed, if the
  contents are not positively known.</p>

  <p>When a healthy person is taken severely and <i>suddenly</i> ill
  <i>soon after some substance has been swallowed</i>, we may suspect that
  he has been poisoned. In all cases where poison has been taken into the
  stomach, it should be quickly and thoroughly evacuated by some active
  emetic, which can be speedily obtained. This may be accomplished by
  drinking a tumblerful of warm water, containing either a tablespoonful of
  powdered mustard or of common salt, or two teaspoonfuls of powdered alum
  in two tablespoonfuls of syrup. When vomiting has already taken place, it
  should be maintained by copious draughts of warm water or mucilaginous
  drinks, such as gum-water or flaxseed tea, and tickling the throat with
  the finger until there is reason to believe that all the poisonous
  substance has been expelled from the stomach.</p>

  <p>The following list embraces only the more common poisons, together
  with such antidotes as are usually at hand, to be used until the
  physician arrives.</p>

<p class="cenhead">POISONS.</p>

  <p><b>Acids.</b>&mdash;<i>Hydrochloric acid</i>; <i>muriatic acid</i>
  (spirits of salt); <i>nitric acid</i> (aqua fortis); <i>sulphuric
  acid</i> (oil of vitriol).</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Antidote.</span>&mdash;An antidote should be given at
  once to neutralize the acid. Strong soapsuds is an efficient remedy, and
  can always be obtained. It should be followed by copious draughts of warm
  water or flaxseed tea. Chalk, magnesia, soda or saleratus (with water) or
  <!-- Page 248 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page248"></a>{248}</span>lime-water, are the best remedies. When
  sulphuric acid has been taken, water should be given sparingly, because,
  when water unites with this acid, intense heat is produced.</p>

  <p><i>Oxalic acid.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Antidote.</span>&mdash;Oxalic acid resembles Epsom
  salts in appearance, and may easily be mistaken for it. The antidotes are
  magnesia, or chalk mixed with water.</p>

  <p><b>Prussic Acid</b>; <i>oil of bitter almonds</i>; <i>laurel
  water</i>; <i>cyanide of potassium</i> (used in electrotyping).</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Antidote.</span>&mdash;Cold douche to the spine.
  Chlorine water, or water of ammonia largely diluted, should be given, and
  the vapor arising from them may be inhaled.</p>

  <p><b>Alkalies and their Salts.</b>&mdash;<span class="sc">Ammonia</span>
  (hartshorn), <i>liquor or water of ammonia</i>. <span
  class="sc">Potassa</span>:&mdash;<i>caustic potash</i>, <i>strong
  ley</i>, <i>carbonate of potassa</i> (pearlash), <i>nitrate of
  potassa</i> (saltpetre).</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Antidote.</span>&mdash;Give the vegetable acids
  diluted, as weak vinegar, acetic, citric, or tartaric acids dissolved in
  water. Castor oil, linseed oil, and sweet oil may also be used; they form
  soaps when mixed with the free alkalies, which they thus render harmless.
  The poisonous effects of saltpetre must be counteracted by taking
  mucilaginous drinks freely, so as to produce vomiting.</p>

  <p><b>Alcohol.</b>&mdash;<i>Brandy</i>, <i>wine</i>; <i>all spirituous
  liquors</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Antidote.</span>&mdash;Give as an emetic ground
  mustard or tartar emetic. If the patient cannot swallow, introduce a
  stomach pump; pour cold water on the head.</p>

  <p><b>Gases.</b>&mdash;<i>Chlorine</i>, <i>carbonic acid gas</i>,
  <i>carbonic oxide</i>, <i>fumes of burning charcoal</i>, <i>sulphuretted
  hydrogen</i>, <i>illuminating or coal-gas</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Antidote.</span>&mdash;For poisoning by chlorine,
  inhale, cautiously, ammonia (hartshorn). For the other gases, cold water
  should be poured upon the head, and stimulants cautiously administered;
  artificial respiration. (See <i>Marshall Hall's Ready Method</i>, page <a
  href="#page250">250</a>.)</p>

  <p><b>Metals.</b>&mdash;<i>Antimony</i>, <i>tartar emetic</i>, <i>wine of
  antimony</i>, etc.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Antidote.</span>&mdash;If vomiting has not occurred,
  it should be produced by tickling the throat with the finger or a
  feather, and the abundant use of warm water. Astringent infusions, such
  as common tea, oak bark, and solution of tannin, act as antidotes.</p>

  <p><b>Arsenic.</b>&mdash;<i>White arsenic</i>, <i>Fowler's solution</i>,
  <i>fly-powder</i>, <i>cobalt</i>, <i>Paris green</i>, etc.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Antidote.</span>&mdash;Produce vomiting at once with
  a tablespoonful or two of powdered mustard in a glass of warm water, or
  with ipecac. The antidote is hydrated peroxide of iron. If Fowler's
  solution has been taken, lime-water must be given. <!-- Page 249 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page249"></a>{249}</span></p>

  <p><b>Copper.</b>&mdash;<i>Acetate of copper</i> (verdigris), <i>sulphate
  of copper</i> (blue vitriol), food cooked in dirty <i>copper vessels</i>,
  or pickles made green by <i>copper</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Antidote.</span>&mdash;Milk or white of eggs, with
  mucilaginous drinks (flaxseed tea, etc.), should be freely given.</p>

  <p><b>Iron.</b>&mdash;<i>Sulphate of iron</i> (copperas), etc.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Antidote.</span>&mdash;Carbonate of soda in some
  mucilaginous drink, or in water, is an excellent antidote.</p>

  <p><b>Lead.</b>&mdash;<i>Acetate of lead</i> (sugar of lead),
  <i>carbonate of lead</i> (white lead), water kept in <i>leaden pipes</i>
  or <i>vessels</i>, food cooked in <i>vessels</i> glazed with
  <i>lead</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Antidote.</span>&mdash;Induce vomiting with ground
  mustard or common salt in warm water. The antidote for soluble
  preparations of lead is Epsom salts; for the insoluble forms, sulphuric
  acid largely diluted.</p>

  <p><b>Mercury.</b>&mdash;<i>Bichloride of mercury</i> (corrosive
  sublimate), <i>ammoniated mercury</i> (white precipitate), <i>red oxide
  of mercury</i> (red precipitate), <i>red sulphuret of mercury</i>
  (vermilion).</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Antidote.</span>&mdash;The white of eggs, or wheat
  flour beaten up with water and milk, are the best antidotes.</p>

  <p><b>Silver.</b>&mdash;<i>Nitrate of silver</i> (lunar caustic).</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Antidote.</span>&mdash;Give a teaspoonful of common
  salt in a tumbler of water. It decomposes the salts of silver and
  destroys their activity.</p>

  <p><b>Zinc.</b>&mdash;<i>Sulphate of zinc</i>, etc. (white vitriol).</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Antidote.</span>&mdash;The vomiting may be relieved
  by copious draughts of warm water. The antidote is carbonate of soda
  administered in water.</p>

  <p><b>Narcotic Poisons.</b>&mdash;<i>Opium</i> (laudanum, paregoric,
  salts of morphia, Godfrey's cordial, Dalby's carminative, soothing syrup,
  cholera mixtures), <i>aconite</i>, <i>belladonna</i>, <i>hemlock</i>,
  <i>stramonium</i>, <i>digitalis</i>, <i>tobacco</i>, <i>hyosciamus</i>,
  <i>nux vomica</i>, <i>strychnine</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Antidote.</span>&mdash;Evacuate the stomach by the
  most active emetics, as mustard, alum, or sulphate of zinc. The patient
  should be kept in motion, and cold water dashed on the head and
  shoulders. Strong coffee must be given. The physician will use the
  stomach pump and electricity. In poisoning by nux vomica or strychnine,
  etc., chloroform or ether should be inhaled to quiet the spasms.</p>

  <p><b>Irritant Vegetable Poisons.</b>&mdash;<i>Croton oil</i>, <i>oil of
  savine</i>, <i>poke</i>, <i>oil of tansy</i>, etc.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Antidote.</span>&mdash;If vomiting has taken place,
  it may be rendered easier by copious draughts of warm water. But if
  symptoms of insensibility have come on without vomiting, it ought to be
  immediately excited by ground mustard mixed with warm water, or some

<p class="cenhead">DROWNING.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Marshall Hall's "Ready Method"</span> of treatment in
  asphyxia from drowning, chloroform, coal gas, etc.</p>

  <p>1st. Treat the patient <i>instantly on the spot</i>, in the <i>open
  air</i>, freely exposing the face, neck, and chest to the breeze, except
  in severe weather.</p>

  <p>2d. In order <i>to clear the throat</i>, place the patient gently on
  the face, with one wrist under the forehead, that all fluid, and the
  tongue itself, may fall forward, and leave the entrance into the windpipe
  free.</p>

  <p>3d. <i>To excite respiration</i>, turn the patient slightly on his
  side, and apply some irritating or stimulating agent to the nostrils, as
  <i>veratrine</i>, <i>dilute ammonia</i>, etc.</p>

  <p>4th. Make the face warm by brisk friction; then dash cold water upon
  it.</p>

  <p>5th. If not successful, lose no time; but, <i>to imitate
  respiration</i>, place the patient on his face, and turn the body gently,
  but completely <i>on the side, and a little beyond</i>; then again on the
  face, and so on, alternately. Repeat these movements, deliberately and
  perseveringly, <!-- Page 251 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page251"></a>{251}</span><i>fifteen times only</i> in a minute.
  (When the patient lies on the thorax, this cavity is <i>compressed</i> by
  the weight of the body, and <i>ex</i>piration takes place. When he is
  turned on the side, this pressure is removed, and <i>in</i>spiration
  occurs.)</p>

  <p>6th. When the prone position is resumed, make a uniform and efficient
  pressure <i>along the spine</i>, removing the pressure immediately,
  before rotation on the side. (The pressure augments the
  <i>ex</i>piration: the rotation commences <i>in</i>spiration.) Continue
  these measures.</p>

  <p>7th. Rub the limbs <i>upward</i>, with <i>firm pressure</i> and with
  <i>energy</i>. (The object being to aid the return of venous blood to the
  heart.)</p>

  <p>8th. Substitute for the patient's wet clothing, if possible, such
  other covering as can be instantly procured, each bystander supplying a
  coat or cloak, etc. Meantime, and from time to time, <i>to excite
  inspiration</i>, let the surface of the body be <i>slapped</i> briskly
  with the hand.</p>

  <p>9th. Rub the body briskly till it is dry and warm, then dash
  <i>cold</i> water upon it, and repeat the rubbing.</p>

  <p>Avoid the immediate removal of the patient, as it involves a
  <i>dangerous loss of time</i>&mdash;also, the use of bellows, or any
  <i>forcing</i> instrument; also, the <i>warm bath</i>, and <i>all rough
  treatment</i>.</p>
